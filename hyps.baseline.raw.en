is it finally a solution to avoid the types of &apos; Roma &apos; ?
for Mr R@@ iz@@ z@@ o , it is often a waste of time .
in his Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o New York , S@@ mar@@ ts C@@ it@@ y Putin will be dependent on the cli@@ ents of the cli@@ ents , and will call the car@@ ro@@ ts , the pi@@ z@@ za and po@@ ta@@ to@@ ic .
however , it is about automatic messages that are trying to push fraud through fraud .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou are coming to the point that it does not allow other speakers to get us into the hands of &apos; , said a 2@@ 4-@@ year-old base ow@@ ner .
aid is on the road , albeit slowly .
in the last year , the government inspired by the mobile phones has been included in the new tool for preventing un@@ wanted &apos; Roma &apos; .
the Com@@ m@@ pi@@ te Com@@ m@@ is has proposed to allow telephone companies to block more sub-@@ prime speeches and hopes to dece@@ ive the petitions with large fines .
according to experts , these steps are not a definitive solution , but they are a good start .
f@@ ed@@ eral@@ ist , non-@@ re@@ tic@@ ation@@ -@@ ca@@ ps should protect people from un@@ wanted from distance distributors .
however , fra@@ ud@@ sters do not care that they are in breach of the law .
fra@@ ud@@ sters reach people from cheap and easily , using &apos; automatic voters &apos; , which is automatically making a lot of speeches at once automatically .
it is estimated that the Americans receive tens of millions of Roma per day .
all of them are , of course , not fraudulent .
pharma@@ cies , for example , send out messages about the implementation of prescri@@ ptions .
but all too often , the situation is as follows : you are paying money to the tax agency ; Mic@@ ro@@ so@@ f@@ ti calls for your compu@@ ters to be made ; free mon@@ ies are being proposed !
in addition , the sub-@@ prime technology is used by a complex technology , which shows a number of cre@@ w to a local or important issue , such as the tax authority .
the implementation of suitable measures for the figures for &apos; intended &apos; figures would aggra@@ vate fraud and help prevent millions of dollars in the United States , as stated by the Chi@@ ef Pro@@ secu@@ tive Pro@@ secu@@ tive Group of the State prosecu@@ tors , as stated in the f@@ c@@ c document .
telephone companies and independent applications can go to war or to block un@@ wanted speeches compared with the database &apos;s database and analyse suspect behaviour , such as the number , which will call a number of people in or@@ ch@@ es@@ ca@@ ps .
there is also a to@@ ol@@ box that will also have a to@@ ol@@ box that will add such warnings on income , such as a &apos; T@@ y@@ m@@ is fraud &apos; , but they are not in all the telephone or to many cli@@ ents available to many of the ma@@ pping of the ma@@ pping .
they will be allowed to order from V@@ specialised and S@@ P@@ in@@ ti@@ a .
some of the same phones , including Google Pi@@ x@@ el , are un@@ paid for free speech free of charge .
Mr Mul@@ ti@@ media production , J@@ en V@@ ar@@ ga ( 39 ) Or@@ thodox F@@ l@@ id@@ te said , said that his implementation of the A@@ T &amp; D ro@@ ckets will be labelled and blocked certain hand@@ outs in his mobile phones , but on telephone mines he has abandoned .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou are very rare to object to the figures that I do not know about &apos; , said in War@@ saw .
the applications such as Y@@ ou@@ man and N@@ om@@ o@@ ro@@ b@@ o offer free , but with restrictions .
in the case of Y@@ ou@@ Ma@@ k , the operator must allow &apos; conditional speeches &apos; to &apos; , which is direc@@ ting speeches &apos; , if you do not answer the line or it is bus@@ y .
N@@ om@@ o@@ ro@@ b@@ o is not available to all ear@@ ners of telephone telephone services and are not working with parents , pi@@ se@@ -based telephone engine@@ ers .
it is also possible to purchase the vi@@ ad , some of them are rather cu@@ mber@@ some , which are blocked in the telephone phones .
V@@ ar@@ z@@ is also tests on dubious calls for warnings on the number of Israeli telephone calls .
telephone companies are already able to block certain speeches that are fraudulent .
F@@ c has proposed rules for the form@@ alisation of such tra@@ in@@ e@@ es@@ hi@@ ps and the blocking of other kinds of fraud that are suspected of fraud .
this means that it can be blocked by V@@ speci@@ z@@ is , which is going to accept speeches , but it will never start any time .
operators would also be able to block speech on which they know that they are not legal , such as the 9@@ 11 guidelines .
these rules still need to be finalised .
the M@@ au@@ re@@ en Ma@@ h@@ on@@ e@@ y , the public order of non-@@ profit consumers in the Union said that these developments are &apos; encouraging &apos; , but does not protect consumers from all un@@ wanted speeches .
first of all , the non-@@ application of non-@@ applications to certain types of call , such as creditors and political campaigns .
in addition , f@@ c@@ c rules , Mr Ma@@ h@@ on@@ e@@ y , would cover only counterfeit figures .
all the Roma are not intended to be s@@ wind@@ led .
consumer union wishes to make the telephone companies available free of charge to all consumers free of charge .
in the long run , the f@@ cas@@ c industry supports the effort to confirm that the hel@@ m is really what it claims to be .
perhaps one day , it will be possible to see a green phones on the scre@@ en , when the hel@@ m is legitimate .
a lob@@ by@@ ist lobby , U@@ .@@ S@@ S@@ . Tele@@ com says that it can take several years , but it would be a powerful tool against the Roma .
F@@ c is also looking for ways of putting an end to the words to consumers who are changing the numbers .
if we are to register itself at the moment , but to have a new number later , it may not be able to know it , and may be able to take a quar@@ rel in the new line .
&apos;@@ R@@ ob@@ o@@ ther@@ rs are not going anywhere &apos; , Mr F@@ os@@ s N@@ om@@ o@@ ro@@ bo@@ se , which is a service to block speech for mobile and home phones .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou are a criminal and find a new way of circum@@ ven@@ ting from any system .
but our job is to make this as difficult for them .
there are several logical measures that consumers should implement .
do not answer the telephone when you do not know the numbers .
yes , it is , unfortunately , not practical for companies in companies such as S@@ por@@ ts C@@ it@@ y .
stop un@@ wanted speech .
do not speak against or press any bu@@ tton .
if you engage with them , they can be noted to you who will respond and to bur@@ y you under more speeches .
if possible , the number of people will be blocked in the event of the opportunity .
make use of applications being blocked .
if you have some concerns about privacy , check the rules on implementation in order to see whether it shares your speech or contact data with distributors .
do not present the personal data , such as bank account or social security figures .
Nor@@ de@@ a and D@@ N@@ B will become a reality at the end of the year at the end of the year .
the financial group of the F@@ N@@ B and Nor@@ min@@ or Baltic units will only become a reality in the last quarter of this year , wri@@ tes a business day .
the opening up of the common legal chain has been delayed .
following the publication of the accession plans in the summer of the summer , the banks referred to the completion of the transaction to be completed in the second quarter .
in April , however , the D@@ N@@ B communication leader said that this is being delayed in the third quarter .
in particular , the Swedish financial inspe@@ c@@ torate provided additional instructions to meet the regional significance of the Swedish Bank .
Russia &apos;s railway will investigate the possibility of getting the S@@ t Bud@@ d@@ h@@ ic Kal@@ in@@ ing@@ ra@@ di@@ -@@ Berlin passenger train to be carried out .
the Russian railway is to examine the possibility of getting the Ber@@ lin@@ -@@ S@@ t Peter@@ s@@ burg train in Kal@@ in@@ ing@@ rad , announced by the Director of Kal@@ in@@ ing@@ rad , Vik@@ tor G@@ ol@@ om@@ ol@@ z@@ in , the Director@@ tor G@@ ol@@ om@@ ol@@ z@@ ine , the Director of the Kal@@ in@@ gen G@@ ol@@ om@@ ol@@ z@@ ine Se@@ ve@@ pan@@ t .
it is about the fact that , from an economic point of view , it is scarcely possible to put the Kal@@ in@@ ing@@ ra@@ di@@ -@@ Berlin train on the Kal@@ in@@ ing@@ ra@@ -@@ Berlin train .
and we are offering the second route - Ber@@ li@@ in Kal@@ in@@ ing@@ rad S@@ t S@@ t .
there are technical options for this , both in terms of infrastructure and rolling stock &apos; , said G@@ ol@@ om@@ ol@@ z@@ in .
Mr G@@ ol@@ om@@ ol@@ z mentioned that there are already Russian trains , which can be replaced by rob@@ ber@@ y and continuing to move to Europe &apos;s pre@@ da@@ tory .
G@@ ol@@ om@@ ol@@ z believes that this direction is from a perspective , because at the moment , the inhabitants of S@@ t Peter@@ s@@ burg and the nor@@ th-@@ east of Russia have to travel to Germany and to the B@@ ar .
as a possible vari@@ ation , Latvia , Latvia , Latvia , the Latvian railway force in the L@@ at@@ vi@@ l O@@ z@@ ols , who said that there is no specific decision at the moment , but the version is discussed .
Latvia &apos;s railway , together with the Russian railways , seeks to increase competitiveness in order to improve the flow of passengers so that rail transport can compete with road transport .
the Chinese company in Estonia , in Estonia , made EUR 100 million straight away to the tune of EUR 100 million .
in the case of the A@@ g@@ ri@@ tera of agricultural produce in the Chinese &apos;s ownership of agricultural produce , which took action only last year , EUR 100 million would have achieved almost EUR 100 million .
profits have been made of around EUR 2 million , which will write a business day .
it is clear from the annual report that the rate of sales of agricultural produce and whole@@ sale A@@ g@@ ri@@ tera ( C@@ IS ) to the tune of EUR 10@@ 0.@@ 6 million in 201@@ 6 .
the profits were EUR 1.@@ 91 million .
the economic activity of the company earlier in the company did not happen .
on average , there was no 3 people in the company , in 2015 , no staff have been workers in 2015 .
the cost of the worker per worker to EUR 3@@ 3.@@ 6 million , the average gross cost was EUR 3@@ 16 per month .
we already have a Thursday working week , but not like this , as we are waiting for .
an O@@ p@@ pro@@ ach : S@@ c@@ an@@ x , Pan@@ thin@@ y / Wa@@ ve@@ b@@ rea@@ k L@@ t@@ d L@@ t@@ d
many Est@@ on@@ i@@ ons have already been the week of Thursday &apos;s working week on Thursday .
however , it is not what they are expected to write on the F@@ ri@@ can@@ e Day .
it has created modern working spac@@ es , which is open to an open office .
it takes a lack of 1.5 hours per day in the hands of the in@@ insi@@ ta Office , or almost a day of almost a week of work per week .
however , when a week working week , four working hours , such a working week , would be a forced solution to it .
the working hours of 1.5 hours are a focus on the focus of the focus , instead of bl@@ ending the work , bl@@ ending , increasing an@@ no@@ y@@ ance and anxi@@ ety and the disappearance of the working will .
how would it be financed by the company &apos;s vehicles ?
in a changing consumption society , the financing options for enlarged companies have become more and more so , and more and more companies are also used in full services in full services or a long-term author .
it is two clearly different financial transactions that involve different commitments and expectations , but which , however , often lead to confusion .
it is estimated that , in the case of the international author of Estonia , Estonia &apos;s sales and marketing leader , Vil@@ l T@@ er , we can see that businesses are increasingly moving towards full services in the direction of a services of services and increasing the possibility of long-term renation@@ alisation .
the bridge was highlighted by the main issues that can be chosen by the way in which you are looking for answers can be chosen by the way in which the vehicle is used .
how long will the vehicle be used ?
the biggest distinction between the lea@@ k of cars and the way in which it is used is the time for use .
it is worth giving priority to a long-term vehicle for a long-term vehicle if a plan has a plan to introduce &apos; no &apos; to the long period for a long period &apos; , explained that it would be worth for a vote , if a vehicle is to be used to be able to have a vehicle on a daily basis , but leave the care obligations to the service provider and to &apos; re@@ lin@@ qu@@ ish ownership &apos; .
&apos;@@ R@@ former cars have a considerably shorter period of application , but many major car ren@@ tal companies also provide a long-term car , where a car is carried out without complicated contracts and free recovery &apos; , presented the possibilities of the different car .
who will become a vehicle ow@@ ner ?
when it comes to the end of the publication , the ow@@ ner will become the ow@@ ner &apos;s ow@@ ner .
in the case of &apos; right services , it will be possible to keep on the same or better terms with a series of cu@@ mber@@ some conditions , with an equivalent new vehicle that meets the needs of a company &apos; , in the war , emphasising that , since the consumer &apos;s society is increasingly moving ever more and more to the secondary consumption of services , a vehicle ownership is an additional responsibility for the company .
in addition , there is an opportunity for full-@@ time services to purchase a car on the basis of the desire and agreed conditions .
however , this possibility is not and will only be paid for the operational period .
a car is generally carried out in the representation of car firms and a car ren@@ tal from the temporary agency of ren@@ tal companies .
the offices of the car companies are primarily involved in the car industry , but also the possibility of a li@@ a@@ sion and , in some cases , the author .
however , in the case of R@@ former companies , cars have the sole purpose of having to ren@@ oun@@ ce them .
the war in the war that the causes of the use of the lea@@ k service are different - many companies are temporary , in addition , to make use of com@@ passion or holiday , or if their own car is in an improvement .
in the case of &apos; commercial vehicles &apos; , ever more and more of a total service for services , which provides for transparency in the cost of costs , time from time savings in terms of the purchase , use and re@@ vita@@ lisation of vehicles and more comfor@@ t &apos; , presented a growing path of sales and marketing leader .
every year , more and more businesses use companies in full services for their car fleet , optimis@@ ing its costs and focusing on their main business .
what is the coverage of a service based on the sustainability of services ?
if there is mandatory and motor insurance for cars , the ren@@ tal car is largely covered by basic insurance , and it must be decided whether , for example , an accident insurance , property insurance , early insurance or full insurance , but , in addition to the vehicle and insurance , it will be covered by a custom@@ er &apos;s equivalent payment because , in addition to vehicle and insurance , there will also be more than six charges covered by cars , because , in addition to the vehicle and insurance , 6 % will be covered by car proper care for cars , because , in addition to the vehicle and insurance , 6 % will be covered by car proper care for cars , because , in addition to the vehicle and insurance , 6 payment will also cover the monthly payment of cars , because , in addition to the vehicle and insurance , 6 % will also cover the monthly the exchange of tyres and other agreed services &apos; explained the T@@ o@@ ke .
&apos;@@ W@@ hat can be taken from any new vehicle , in the case of full services , a service provider will help to choose a vehicle for the wishes and needs of a vehicle that takes account of the functions that are also taken into account &apos; , compared with it , emphasising that the full services of services will certainly help to opti@@ mise expenditure on car fleet costs .
however , the choice of &apos; R@@ end@@ l@@ ers &apos; depends , however , from a fleet of service providers - different temporary companies are offering both small and econom@@ ical cars in the urban transport sector in urban transport , as well as for business meetings &apos; , described the T@@ o@@ ke .
it may , of course , have to happen during the close period of ten@@ se that the desired car has already been ren@@ oun@@ ced , but it will help to reservation the desired vehicle at an early stage .
there should be a clear way out of the way between in@@ duc@@ ing or le@@ asing out , should be made clear first and for a long time to make use of the vehicle and which are long-term plans in relation to cars .
it is certainly worth looking carefully at the different conditions and commitments of services .
how did the man built up a report on the subject of 51 million ?
one of the people living in the T@@ e@@ x@@ a@@ y people found that there is no question of the subject of the question in which his disabled da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter could be playing .
he therefore decided to build one .
Gordon H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N had just come out of a family holiday from the family holiday , when its 12-@@ year-old da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter M@@ body approached the children who are playing with other waters .
he tried to keep them to a war , but they have quickly left a bon@@ us from the b@@ ud .
H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N believes that they are real , because they do not know how to treat the disabled person - the Morgan has a five-year g@@ ni@@ tive view and also a certain form of honour .
this incident failed to ha@@ unt it .
&apos;@@ Morgan is a young gir@@ l .
the meeting with him always leads to a s@@ mi@@ le and he is certainly asking him to fish .
but there have been many times where we have not been able to lead it into different places he says &apos; .
H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N and his spo@@ use , Mag@@ gi@@ e , asked the other parents to which they could lead their da@@ u@@ gh@@ e - to get anywhere , and others feel comfortable with him .
&apos;@@ We have reached the conclusion that there is no place in such an inclusive &apos; , there is H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
he therefore decided to build it in 2007 .
a former ob@@ ses@@ sion and sold their own construction companies in the year 2005 in order to establish the F@@ am@@ ila F@@ am@@ ila F@@ am@@ ila F@@ ou@@ n@@ da@@ ti@@ k - a non-@@ profit union that will help disabled people .
he then started &apos; the creation of the most highly accessible theme &apos; in the world .
&apos;@@ We wanted to create a subject in which everything can do everything in which they can be able to play both specific needs and the specific needs of people without specific needs &apos; , say H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
she called for doctors , steel sc@@ he@@ du@@ les , parents and other people without disabilities in order to consult in terms of the facility .
they established a 10-@@ hectares career in San An@@ ton@@ i@@ os T@@ e@@ x@@ a@@ o .
a par@@ k called Morgan W@@ on@@ der@@ l@@ and cost USD 34 million ( GBP 26 million ) and was opened in 2010 .
the number of Ac@@ cor@@ ds is fully accessible , bl@@ ind@@ ing a game of toys and a min@@ g .
visitors say to Har@@ t@@ man often that they were only able to experience such an at@@ ro@@ cious .
there is also a ca@@ us@@ ers that have a de@@ design translation in the wh@@ eel@@ chair , which go beyond animals and under the car@@ pet .
the H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N recognises , however , that Morgan was fe@@ ar@@ ful at the beginning .
&apos;@@ when we opened , it did not dare to go it .
he failed to understand why this round is , and why animals are coming up and under@@ way &apos; , says H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
it took three years before the Morgan was agreed to a ca@@ us@@ ers .
&apos;@@ at the beginning , he simply stood as close to it , but we did not start wars , but we did not start wars .
it was a slow process , but now it love to travel to it .
getting overcome from something that was intimi@@ dated by it was a great deal for him .
the small things achieved by playing the game are a big distinction .
since its opening up , Morgan W@@ on@@ der@@ land has visited a million people from 67 countries and 50 % of all 50 American states .
one third of personnel are free of charge and entry is free to anyone who has a few illnesses .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou understood that Morgan is one happy because it has many things necessary for him .
I did not want the price to be the cost of other specific needs to people &apos; , says H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
&apos;@@ L@@ et every year , knowing that we are at least a loss of USD 750 000 ( GBP 750 000 ) to damages , and we have to return it back to the help of the cor@@ ner and partners &apos; .
this year , Morgan Morgan In@@ ves@@ ti@@ k has been extended by the opening up of I@@ c@@ elan@@ dic water par@@ k , which is to be fully accessible .
&apos;@@ in July , fewer people visited the wh@@ eel@@ chairs because the wh@@ eel@@ chairs became too hot .
we have therefore chosen to set aside the water par@@ k &apos; , Mr H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
in some parts of the island , ther@@ mal water has been used , which will help visitors from meat problems .
there are water@@ tight wh@@ eel@@ s of water@@ tight , which are working on the air , rather than accumu@@ la@@ tors .
there is also a chance to travel on the river .
a total of USD 17 million ( GBP 13 million ) .
&apos;@@ yesterday , a man of the In@@ spi@@ ra@@ tor came to me and I simply kept it to me &apos; , Mr H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou referred to his son who have serious specific needs and started to wa@@ ive .
he said that he had not been able to play in the past in the past .
the Har@@ man has not three par@@ k from every four of the four visits to disabled and par@@ cel , and it is precisely the effect he had hoped for .
&apos;@@ This will help people to understand that , although we are different in some ways , we are in fact exactly the same &apos; , he says .
&apos;@@ I saw a gir@@ l in a wh@@ eel@@ chair , without special needs , and they started to play together .
that was a really sudden &apos; .
there is no intention to open more par@@ k in Har@@ t@@ man@@ i , although he has received hundreds of letters to people who would like to have hundreds of letters from people who would like to par@@ k in their own neighbour .
instead , he is concentrating on the special needs of young people in San An@@ ton@@ i@@ os to provide educational facilities .
&apos;@@ I know that there are a lot of organisations that are trying to build something like the Morgan W@@ on@@ der@@ land , and we will continue to cooperate with them &apos; .
he will continue to play a part in the M@@ organ@@ ic , which is a kind of hearing now in the hands of the Morgan .
&apos;@@ W@@ ho comes here , he is like a ro@@ ck !
many people want to speak with him and to do with him , to do it well , he has a good deal to say &apos; , H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N says .
the Morgan , which is now 2@@ 3-@@ year-old , can increasingly do things .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou are now talking more and the majority of his physical problems have been wa@@ tered down .
we are so proud that he has come as far as &apos; .
if a Morgan par@@ k is visiting , I like him the most fib@@ re and s@@ lee@@ p to play , without any idea how much he has helped others .
&apos;@@ Morgan knows that a par@@ k has obtained the name according to him , but I do not believe that he understands what it actually represents and how this has changed lives &apos; , words H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou do not understand that the way in which he has been cop@@ ing in life has made it a true source of inspiration &apos; .
call to find car leaders in relation to two rape in W@@ it@@ ton
the police are trying to find two drivers of the rape of a 14@@ -@@ year-old gir@@ l in the rape of a 14@@ -@@ year-old gir@@ l .
the teen@@ ager attacked in the W@@ it@@ ton region on 26 July around 2 02 : 00 ( B@@ S@@ T ) .
before this attack , he was ra@@ ped in the W@@ it@@ ton station .
in connection with the first case , there is a man &apos;s indic@@ tment .
the British transport police want to speak as part of an investigation as part of the two car instructions .
according to the police , the first car is the first colour .
the U@@ H@@ G T@@ ony F@@ it@@ z@@ pa@@ ric@@ k war : &apos; we have grounds to believe that a vehicle leader talked with the victim , before the second person was repeated and then the ra@@ pes were ra@@ ped .
we want to know what has been said in this conver@@ sa@@ tions , and the man@@ ager may be aware of the important details that would help us in investigations &apos; .
the second driver leader , which was according to the white V@@ W S@@ har@@ an , according to the police , is likely to be the victim after it had been ra@@ ped when he had been ra@@ ped .
G@@ en@@ i@@ e called G@@ en@@ i@@ e was called a year of growth .

E@@ vi@@ e is diagno@@ sed with a po@@ cket in March 201@@ 6 , and the G@@ en@@ i@@ e had helped him to cope with several painful operations and a long hospital in the hospital .
the ca@@ ke was recognised in the ceremony in London by Pro@@ te@@ se Pro@@ te@@ ro@@ c@@ ti@@ n .
the image of the pu@@ mp : the E@@ vi@@ e said it was worth supporting him when he lost his long bro@@ wn in the ha@@ ven of his long g@@ ni@@ cious bro@@ kers because of his long bro@@ wn .
&apos;@@ I think it is the best .
he deserves it .
he has always been in place &apos; , said the E@@ vi@@ e .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou came to my bit@@ ter and to go next to my feet .
he c@@ oo@@ ked the bit@@ ter and the ju@@ mp , then in order to em@@ ula@@ te my own in his kne@@ es .
when I was too sick to get my friends to come or to go out , and I had to sit at home , he had to come to me and it made me much jo@@ y , offering a great deal of comfor@@ t &apos; .
he said that he has a special link with his pe@@ ts , which was enormous support for him when she lost his ha@@ ir in the face of tragic treatment .
&apos;@@ This five me very much because I had long bro@@ wn Je@@ ws .
but since the par@@ k was going to time , time G@@ en@@ i@@ e G@@ en@@ i@@ e is the same way , and that I lost my own ha@@ ir and G@@ en@@ i@@ e himself , which was a little bit of a shock &apos; .
Mrs H@@ end@@ er@@ son said that the benefits have been &apos; mar@@ vel@@ ling &apos; and described how the E@@ vi@@ e had been stu@@ mb@@ ling vi@@ de@@ o@@ es in hospital .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou had more than 300 days in the hospital , so we spent a lot of time there , and it offered him something to wait for him to wait for a few valuable days .

he is my best friend , and I really do not know what I do not .
the business group will be a@@ ol@@ ing the government to agree on the transitional conditions of the Bre@@ x in the transitional conditions of the Bre@@ x .
one of the largest groups of business lob@@ bies in Britain is to stop the government around the f@@ ring@@ es of the Bre@@ x@@ es .
the In@@ s@@ ma of Di@@ versity ( I@@ I@@ D ) addressed the government to make a &apos; transitional agreement &apos; in order to make the Bre@@ x@@ al@@ a s@@ m@@ oo@@ ther progress .
it is intended that the government would create a &apos; bridge &apos; between the &apos; Brit@@ tan@@ y &apos; and the setting up of new commercial agreements .
the group warned that , without such an agreement , the &apos; short-term cha@@ otic fish &apos; will be &apos; short-term cha@@ otic &apos; .
they critici@@ ses the government &apos; transition in all kinds of speculative disputes &apos; for &apos; in@@ ni@@ cious disputes &apos; .
in the last few weeks , the members of the government have presented controversy about how long the transition period is continuing and which it entails .
the I@@ I@@ D report in the I@@ D report - the possibility of a transition &apos; is written : &apos; because , instead of doing so , the government must re@@ open a strategic debate on this issue .
this could minimise confusion and uncertainty in this area .
Mr Ly@@ on , the econom@@ ist and the Group of the E@@ con@@ om@@ is@@ ts for the Brit@@ tan@@ ce for the Brit@@ tan@@ ce for the Brit@@ tan@@ y , this week , was described this week , however , of concern about the &apos; pan@@ ic &apos; s@@ lee@@ p &apos; , which is re@@ minis@@ cent of the Y@@ 2@@ K &apos;s fear of fear of the mil@@ lennium &apos;s fear of fear .
in June , Mr Ham@@ mon@@ te warned in June : &apos; there is a large number of business investments , which are being postponed , until businesses see more clearly what the likely result of these debates is &apos; .
Al@@ li@@ e Ren@@ is , the I@@ D and trade policy leader said : &apos; the K@@ an@@ ts@@ le@@ l is entitled to worry about business investment &apos; .
this is one of the most frequent developments , alongside the re@@ allocation of the EU , of the most frequent developments that must be dealt with with the Bre@@ x@@ al@@ a .
the latter applies particularly to the members of the I@@ D in Northern Ireland , who are currently considering a common location or relocation .
the I@@ I@@ D is proposing a number of possibilities , including as follows : the extension of Article 50 agreement until March 201@@ 9 .
membership of the European Economic Area
agreeing to remain within the scope of the EU regulation on the part of the EU
the establishment of a transitional customs agreement as the EU Customs Union
Ren@@ is@@ a said : &apos; I@@ D suggested the transition to these opportunities , in the hope that this in@@ sur@@ gency in a proper debate on how it is best Bre@@ x to the end .
the priorit@@ isation of orders and , hence , the reduction of the risks of getting out of the EU means that short-term cha@@ otic fluctu@@ ations will not be reduced to the future &apos; .

this confusion is evidence of the painful delay of C@@ ric@@ k A@@ us@@ tr@@ al@@ a ( Mrs ) , in achieving a wage agreement , the un@@ decided cre@@ w of the A@@ us@@ g@@ B@@ ö@@ der of the A@@ us@@ g@@ B@@ ö@@ der , the in@@ ner of the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an football f@@ ö@@ der of the A@@ us@@ cal@@ a F@@ ö@@ der and the A@@ F@@ L ( A@@ F@@ L ) , and A@@ F@@ L ( A@@ F@@ L ) in@@ tran@@ sig@@ ence , and the in@@ tran@@ sig@@ ence of Australia football by A@@ F@@ L ( A@@ F@@ L ) in@@ tran@@ sig@@ ence , and the in@@ tran@@ sig@@ ence of Australia football by A@@ F@@ L ( A@@ F@@ L ) , and the in@@ tran@@ sig@@ ence of Australia football by A@@ F@@ L .

the June D@@ an F@@ og@@ el@@ man announced on Thursday , under C@@ ri@@ ti@@ v@@ is C@@ ri@@ ti@@ is As@@ soci@@ ation , in the context of a forum on the C@@ ri@@ ti@@ v@@ ce Soci@@ ety , that Mrs Sta@@ l@@ l@@ one is taking place in the second session of the N@@ B@@ C popular dram@@ a .
on the part of the gu@@ est , Mrs K@@ e@@ v@@ in ( J@@ us@@ ti@@ n K@@ a@@ y ) will be involved in the role of the K@@ e@@ v@@ in ( J@@ us@@ ti@@ in K@@ a@@ y , in a series of fil@@ ms that are taking place at the start of season .
&apos;@@ K@@ e@@ v@@ in plays a great film and we needed a great deal of com@@ passion , Mr F@@ og@@ el@@ man .
at the end of the previous season , the K@@ e@@ v@@ in , a s@@ mi@@ le of a film on the K@@ e@@ v@@ in Ho@@ ward , has been carried out .
at the same time , we see how the deal is involved in the project and will also heating up relations with its own error , which is playing by Alex@@ and@@ ra B@@ re@@ c@@ k@@ en@@ ri@@ dge .
according to F@@ og@@ el@@ man , the &apos; film &apos; , in which K@@ e@@ v@@ in , is involved , &apos; .
&apos;@@ The &apos; sta@@ r of our life &apos; , who plays a s@@ mi@@ le in the past images of the past &apos;s past , was a coincidence as a coincidence in the 2006 film &apos; Ma@@ ck@@ y Bal@@ bo@@ a &apos; &apos;s son .
F@@ og@@ el@@ man said that the c@@ ry of friendship with Sta@@ l@@ l@@ one was probably what helped the char@@ ts to attract a great gu@@ l@@ f .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou have an excellent scenario for us .
I believe that this will be truly exc@@ iting &apos; , in the war , F@@ og@@ el@@ man .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou are returning to te@@ ed@@ ers on 26 September .
in J@@ am@@ es Har@@ ris@@ is , approximately USD 300 000 per year , in order to keep its own body of play in the form of a toy .
each N@@ FL@@ -@@ players are dependent on their own body in order to earn their livelihood .
for this reason , many other at@@ le@@ xi@@ s are investing in a lot of money in terms of body care and restoration in order to keep in the top form .
Y@@ e@@ re@@ y F@@ o@@ w@@ ler &apos;s portal , Mrs F@@ o@@ w@@ ler &apos;s portal , is a closer look at how many cattle are prepared to go further in order to pro@@ long our career .
however , no case , however , is such extreme as extreme , at a 3@@ 9@@ -@@ year-old J@@ am@@ es Har@@ ris@@ oni , a defen@@ der in the 14@@ th season , which is preparing for the protection line and their own .
according to F@@ o@@ w@@ ler , Mr Har@@ ris@@ is a year a year of USD 300 000 to need@@ les , mas@@ cul@@ s , fib@@ res and image .
most of the costs are about travel to the country in order to meet specialists .
&apos;@@ I do not have to keep the bill on such things &apos; , said by Har@@ ris@@ is .
&apos;@@ how to compare money from my expenditure , it is worth considering how I feel &apos; .
M@@ ike Mitchell , Mr Har@@ ris@@ oni and a team of cre@@ w in S@@ tol@@ le@@ r@@ sis , assessed their body to take care of USD 200 000 .
3@@ 0-@@ year Mitchell has been able to rela@@ x the body of &apos; bo@@ dy m@@ ood &apos; , which F@@ o@@ w@@ ler described as the use of &apos; 55 kil@@ o me@@ tal &apos; as a mas@@ ters &apos; .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou on the ground instead of this in ro@@ p , Mr Mitchell said .
&apos;@@ if you have a few tension in the foot and they are going to move around it , it is , at times , painful .
but the tension has been lost immediately .
this is simply be@@ a@@ ten up &apos; .
they are prepared to make further efforts , but the former N@@ V@@ D players Bar@@ ry Co@@ fi@@ el@@ d and R@@ y@@ an Har@@ ris spend USD 50 000 per year on average .
Co@@ ph@@ el@@ d , who played 10 season of the New York Gi@@ an@@ ts and Washington of Washington , has expressed regret that he did not spend more .
&apos;@@ W@@ ho I can go back , I would go even more &apos; , Mr F@@ ow@@ el@@ ler said .
&apos;@@ I would probably at least say at least twice .
I was the first for the first eight years of a career in a very good health .
it would perhaps have been aid to more of aid &apos; .
R@@ y@@ an Sha@@ z@@ i@@ er , a 2@@ 4-@@ year-old bu@@ t-@@ off line , has expressed its willingness to take its waters in the foot@@ print of the S@@ road in S@@ tol@@ le@@ r@@ s .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen you tax USD 100 000 and earn additional three million , this decision was quite simple &apos; , Mr Sha@@ z@@ i@@ er said .
as far as the long-term career is concerned , investing in the recovery of players is much smar@@ ter than the money spent on cars and cotton .
when it comes to the centre of the average , it will be transported if it can play a longer than 30 years of life , more so much to convince her colleagues of his colleagues on the second issue .
but perhaps they will be able to find some local specialists .
how is the car@@ ro@@ t Di@@ ana used as a weapon of ours as a man of ours as a weapon .
when I am thinking of the P@@ rin@@ g Di@@ ana me@@ ig@@ n , the first thing is the bridge .
there is a young person in a young age .
later , a black feature in the B@@ ash@@ ir &apos; Pan@@ or@@ is &apos; in the B@@ B@@ or@@ n &apos; Pan@@ or@@ is , the effect of which has been devastating , when he looked at ri@@ ps , with the famous death rate : &apos; three of us were three , so it was a little too popular &apos; .
the eyes that were surroun@@ ded by his sen@@ se , the de@@ g@@ no@@ sis of his s@@ lee@@ ves in the face of a s@@ mi@@ le in the face of the blacklist , left the impression open to him .
it is precisely the effect that she has made in trying to achieve .
outside the public , the P@@ rin@@ g Di@@ ana never borne in a particular man , at least not with modern standards .
it was not just that he did not need it - he was , of course , a beautiful one - but he saw a s@@ mi@@ le commitment in this regard , something that is linked to work rather than a sense .
the public has been faced with a mon@@ yer la@@ yer .
once again , he arrived in the offices of Mrs Con@@ de , V@@ o@@ gu@@ e , to the offices of the V@@ o@@ gu@@ e , to have a tax on almost the O@@ range Day .
he has apolo@@ gies to say that his s@@ kin@@ n has to s@@ lee@@ p the sun , because if he were to &apos; usually &apos; , then wal@@ k to look at him and then put all accusations that he see &apos; the &apos; s@@ mi@@ le &apos; , &apos; dark &apos; , &apos; dark &apos; , &apos; dark &apos; and &apos; ti@@ red &apos; .
it was for this reason that Mrs Di@@ ana three times went to an offence in an insul@@ ting way , using the machine at home .
this is , of course , a way of doing so , for a healthy basis , but it was a useful objective for Mrs Di@@ ana , but it enabled him to show the world of his solar character , even though his internal di@@ ligence fulfilled the black cl@@ ou@@ ds and mid@@ night .
one of the most important defec@@ ts in the king of the king of the king of the king of the Ro@@ king family was to believe that , if they are to accept him as a rapporteur for C@@ har@@ les &apos;s spouses , they will be able to have one small ca@@ ke of tri@@ ps , who have only the sugar ba@@ r .
reality , however , was quite the opposite .
he did not have to be the best of the class in schools , but when it came to the creation of the image of the image , it was a very historic student .
for Mrs Di@@ ana , the significance of so@@ ya was to be able to take advantage of them in order to give them more or more .
otherwise they did not give him the slightest interest .
his friend R@@ os@@ k Mon@@ ck@@ ton - Di@@ ana , was in memory of her young child - that we did not have nothing to talk about what they were talking about .
&apos;@@ I remember that &apos; I said &apos; , he said &apos; how much relief he felt on those occasions when we went back to the rest and he did not have to be a man &apos; .
today , we tend to think of a man that enhan@@ ces a woman &apos;s expression , but it is clear that it is clear that she used this powerful P@@ P@@ R as a tool .
those moments in which he felt the most open were the most of his own , it is those moments when he was also the most natural when he was the most natural .
in 1993 , in addition to the two young bo@@ ys of T@@ hor@@ pe , I was thro@@ wing away from the ba@@ g and warmly returned from the eyes of the c@@ ry , b@@ ind@@ ing the eyes of the c@@ oo@@ k , at all other e@@ lep@@ h@@ ant , who will spend a day with children .
four months after the announcement of his and C@@ har@@ les , she saw a de@@ fi@@ ance of concern and &apos; normal &apos; .
or in the years of training in the years , the Je@@ ws set up in cy@@ c@@ ell@@ s , in the form of cy@@ c@@ ling in cy@@ c@@ ell@@ h@@ s , in the form of training , health and the life@@ blood of each other in his po@@ or@@ ies .
to put an end to his life , when she started to assert his independence and his self-@@ confidence , we saw more and more such a Di@@ an@@ a .
he was coherent with H@@ al@@ o T@@ rub@@ t and wal@@ k in January in January in 1997 .
at the time at 3@@ 5-@@ ye@@ ar-@@ ol@@ ds , the mil@@ len@@ ic and natural , almost completely me@@ ig@@ ic and natural , you would probably see it out than ever before , reminding you of the sh@@ ining and hopeful young gir@@ l , who laugh@@ ing 15 years ago .
Mrs Di@@ ana was just reaching his best years .
in early times , it was a prerequisite of the early R@@ a@@ ja@@ c nature of Di@@ ana S@@ pen@@ c@@ is .
but it did not happen long up to the &apos; g@@ in@@ si@@ fication &apos; - a process that was primarily blocked by the b@@ ud and pay in order to make a re@@ fined young ne@@ are@@ st young person who would be worthy of their new status .
this was partly involved in the C@@ la@@ y@@ ton Ho@@ ward , a ch@@ lor@@ ine ch@@ ig@@ n , who often used photo@@ graph@@ ic , working work .
Mr Ho@@ w@@ ard met , for the first time , S@@ no@@ w@@ d@@ on in the city of S@@ no@@ w@@ on in the city of S@@ no@@ w@@ on in order to record a formal la@@ yer for the ma@@ ga@@ e for the ma@@ ga@@ e .
at the end of the 1980s , at the end of the 1980s , Di@@ ana was only empty .
his best beau@@ ty products were a T@@ he S@@ h@@ oping , such as El@@ der S@@ h@@ an &apos;s eyes .
Ho@@ w@@ ard used the Ma@@ x F@@ ac@@ ker S@@ he@@ er G@@ en@@ i@@ us in G@@ en@@ i@@ da G@@ en@@ i@@ us , every H@@ one@@ y in G@@ en@@ i@@ e G@@ en@@ i@@ us , each F@@ ro@@ s@@ te C@@ or@@ al , at the time and the Ma@@ x F@@ ac@@ storm .
it has given Mrs K@@ a@@ tar to Eli@@ z@@ a@@ be@@ th , R@@ ice and Times , and to gol@@ ber@@ ts and the White Paper on the white paper .
it was a ca@@ ke of E@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ be@@ th Ar@@ den Sin@@ ti and Sin@@ ine K@@ a@@ v@@ a@@ be@@ th .
and we know all this because Ho@@ w@@ ard created the figure for him .
&apos;@@ Di@@ versity has such a admi@@ rable colour that I wanted to underline their striking blue to emphasise &apos; , he wrote later .
the end result , however , is not particularly attractive for such a young gir@@ l - he looks like a 18@@ -@@ year-old one who is becoming 50 .
it is too pressing and too much of the e@@ lep@@ h@@ ant .
the most striking thing is the no@@ tori@@ ous bridge in the no@@ tori@@ ous bridge of the ton@@ ge@@ -@@ old D@@ is@@ ne@@ y in this ton@@ y@@ al D@@ is@@ ne@@ y .
F@@ an@@ i@@ an@@ i@@ an@@ i@@ an@@ i@@ an@@ i@@ an@@ i@@ an@@ i@@ an ca@@ ke of fan@@ tas@@ y .
it is not , then , wonder why Mrs Di@@ ana &apos;s little is looking at us .
one source of migration was the fact that he never knew where the public per person will stop and starts privacy .
that was the beginning of this process .
the person who is likely to be most likely to be affected was M@@ ary G@@ re@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ l , who plays an important role in today &apos;s modern world .
we are still one in the world world , who is currently in the C@@ han@@ el since the C@@ han@@ el , is still one of the world &apos;s i@@ al@@ o@@ es .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou had an incredibly beautiful sk@@ in and long s@@ lot &apos; , rec@@ alls .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou were simply in a beautiful way .
the men talked about him .
he was sex without having tried it &apos; .
Mrs Di@@ ana , for the first time in 199@@ 1 , when the V@@ o@@ gu@@ e i , Mrs Har@@ ve@@ y , asked him to do so before December , a ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine Pat@@ ric@@ k D@@ em@@ ar@@ che@@ li@@ er , one of the most expensive photo@@ graph@@ ic photo@@ graph@@ ic photo@@ graph@@ ic photo@@ graph@@ s .
the team also famous ha@@ ir S@@ am Mc@@ K@@ n@@ ig@@ h@@ ic .
it took place when Mrs Di@@ ana and C@@ har@@ les had the highest and public support that started on behalf of the most important and public support .
&apos;@@ they did not tell us who is , although we knew that this is someone &apos;s very famous &apos; , said G@@ re@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ l .
&apos;@@ when we arrived in , Mrs Di@@ ana simply was a beautiful one , it was so@@ ya and friendly , and it is very ex@@ cited that it can be &apos; on the front of the V@@ o@@ gu@@ e &apos; .
this c@@ abin@@ et - Di@@ ana simplified m@@ un@@ s , a l@@ un@@ k , is on the support of the ba@@ g , his eyes to your eyes diff@@ ered , the eyes of the French man@@ ager of the e@@ lep@@ h@@ ant , to a short cut off to the short term - was revolu@@ tion@@ ist .
it was a little positive , indi@@ vi@@ du@@ ality and the e@@ leg@@ ant .
it was , above all , modern , by making progress on a minim@@ alist es@@ tra@@ te of the n@@ in@@ th and creating a strong con@@ tras@@ ts between Di@@ ana and the Qu@@ e@@ en family , who faced the &apos; do@@ se hor@@ ri@@ bi@@ lis &apos; , as the Qu@@ e@@ en mentioned it afterwards .
&apos;@@ Di@@ ana was in a very tight manner with regard to his me@@ mber@@ some .
he simply wanted to see a fresh , different &apos; , said G@@ re@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ l .
during time , she taught Mr Di@@ ana himself - the cre@@ w , the version , a s@@ mi@@ r , a hand@@ o@@ ke , a hand@@ ful of brid@@ ges , a c@@ oo@@ k che@@ que , a c@@ oo@@ k che@@ que and emphasised healthy na@@ iv@@ ety , encouraging him to take good care for themselves and to observe a man@@ tra &apos; internal beau@@ ty &apos; .
Mrs Di@@ ana has done everything in a moderate manner , Mr G@@ re@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ l .
he has got enough and reduced the consumption of alcohol , which is very important for the sk@@ in to the sk@@ in .
the P@@ in@@ min@@ n favoured the Gu@@ er@@ la@@ in che@@ ese , C@@ lar@@ ine h@@ ul@@ l and Wil@@ d Ro@@ se Wil@@ d &apos;s s@@ a .
however , the biggest service that M@@ ary Di@@ ana did , was his stran@@ gers from your eyes to your eyes .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou simply said it as much parents &apos; , he said .
instead , he used a combination of the tone of soft li@@ g@@ ni@@ ties and neutrality , together with the g@@ ard@@ s@@ s@@ ci@@ es of lead , which were inter@@ tw@@ ined , so all of the ser@@ d@@ inal soft .
he is often merely used at the time and a little solar c@@ ot@@ ter in order to underline Mrs Di@@ healthy &apos;s report .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou had a ha@@ bit of calling me to call me and to call on me to discuss products that I enjoyed very much to be &apos; , said to me .
&apos;@@ I think it was a loo@@ se for him ; the opportunity to take a few moments &apos; .
his fav@@ ou@@ rite was the luxury of lu@@ cky C@@ lar@@ k C@@ lar@@ k .
Mrs Di@@ ana used the day and the night of the day and the night , and their Al@@ p@@ ine medicinal products in Al@@ p@@ ine medicinal products and their Al@@ p@@ ine medicinal products , and their Al@@ p@@ ine medicinal products .
he also went to cosme@@ tics in a cosme@@ tic manner in a regular ex@@ hibi@@ tion .
Mr Di@@ an@@ al had a great deal of fu@@ r , but sometimes he had Roma c@@ em@@ bas@@ sies , moder@@ ation , which is often caused by stress .
in order to mitigate it , it has used natural peace , including fib@@ re oil .
&apos;@@ The Di@@ an@@ al was a luxury structure &apos; , said in G@@ re@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ l .
the only part of his a@@ ven@@ ue for which he was not very self-@@ confident was his no@@ se .
Mr Har@@ ve@@ y : &apos; once , when newspapers write that he had been going to me , he went to me and said to me : &apos; honestly , if I have allowed me to wal@@ k , if you are going to be be@@ a@@ ten , if you were to be able to be@@ tra@@ y , then , if you were to be able to be@@ tra@@ y ? &apos;
when the advice of M@@ ary G@@ re@@ en@@ w@@ el@@ li and S@@ am Mc@@ K@@ n@@ ig@@ h@@ t started off , I felt that Mrs Di@@ ana himself was increasingly self-@@ confident about his new expression .
one of the most positive developments in the public - in London in London in London , in the gallery in the gallery of the famous &apos; reven@@ ge &apos; , which has heard the famous &apos; reven@@ ge &apos; by Chris@@ tina Sta@@ sta@@ r , the op@@ pres@@ sive ex@@ pe@@ l@@ ling from Chris@@ tina Sta@@ sta@@ r - has shown that I have come up with his life for the endless years of his life .
the short and above the e@@ ars behind the e@@ ars are bl@@ unt and dynamic , his brief so@@ en@@ g in a sharp contrast to a very challenging g@@ ard@@ stick .
his me@@ tre is perfect , but at the same time the hu@@ mble , black and white eye of his eyes to the eyes of his eyes is perfect .
but not just the e@@ lep@@ h@@ ant col@@ our@@ ings , in particular , the g@@ loom@@ y came to the do@@ g of the do@@ g , a rather probably Re@@ v@@ l@@ are re@@ t , which then became a br@@ and in some sense .
a few months later , she has avoided its e@@ leg@@ ant of his e@@ leg@@ ant in the Kingdom of Justice in the Kingdom of Justice in the Kingdom of Justice in the Kingdom of Justice .
the car@@ go was the ca@@ ke of health and self-@@ confidence .
finally , she also has full control .
in a daily and form , his me@@ ga@@ in@@ ous , he will continue exactly what he wants to see in order to look at it : a woman who seems to be at last to have a suicide and objective in life and who are , after all , after 36 , have found our place .
it is a real pity that he has failed to prove it .
IA@@ A@@ F war@@ ns that the petitions are monitored in the London world champi@@ on@@ ship in a sharp manner .
on Friday in London , world champi@@ ons and the a@@ th@@ le@@ tes are more in the face of d@@ oping in the face of d@@ oping than ever in the past .

&apos;@@ Y@@ ou cannot rule out that the creative of people does not allow such things to happen .
we can say , however , that we have the best practices and the best anti-@@ d@@ oping programme , which will be able to be on the basis of information and data at all , and we will see the result after the event &apos; , said by Mr Ho@@ w@@ man , the A@@ I@@ U High Representative .

sub@@ ju@@ gating trans@@ cri@@ ts of tru@@ mp trans@@ cri@@ es are likely to be a federal crime , according to the former public prosecu@@ tors .

in the first time , the first hand of the Mexic@@ an Government in the first ordered a stop to the public leader that his government does not pay for a border wall .
according to newspapers , trans@@ cri@@ ts included the notes that suggest that the national Security Council has been classified by the Supreme Court of the National Security Council .
the Po@@ st the Po@@ st said that it was a whole series of trans@@ cri@@ ts that were &apos; put together by the White House &apos; and which were based on the reports by the White House and the White House .

although some of these speeches had already come before the public in February , the publication of trans@@ cri@@ ts is a much greater blow to the White M@@ y , who are trying to reduce le@@ aks .

he said that &apos; there may be a s@@ mi@@ le on this issue , referring to investigations and a decision to be investigated by the former Secretary of State H@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton .
these considerations include the document &apos;s labels and history and its precise classi@@ fications .
in the event of sal@@ vation , prosecu@@ tors will be investigated as to whether a document was un@@ authorised in a way that adver@@ sely affects the interests of the United States .
&apos;@@ if all this can prove , people can undoubtedly have been crimin@@ alised in a defen@@ sive &apos; , said in Bur@@ n@@ s .
&apos;@@ There is no question &apos; .
when you talk about the trans@@ cri@@ tics of the telephone calls , the di@@ G@@ en@@ o@@ va , who was the prosecu@@ tor of the S@@ pea@@ ker , that such documents are &apos; usually classified as a secret in a secret and e@@ ars &apos; .
by saying that these le@@ aks are threatened by the US Government &apos;s ability to pursue foreign policy , it turned to the General Pro@@ secu@@ tor of the United States to call for a total of a f@@ ed@@ eral@@ ist prosecu@@ tor in order to find a s@@ mi@@ le .
he also said that he would be able to have a legal arrangement - something that the re@@ por@@ ters would certainly be prote@@ sting to protest .
the New Senate of U@@ TA@@ H , M@@ ike Le@@ e , said that there should be a criminal procedure in the case of a sal@@ va@@ ged information .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou have to find a person who was le@@ ak@@ ed - he must be punished , and it must be un@@ le@@ as@@ hed &apos; , said by Le@@ e Fo@@ x Ne@@ ws &apos; H@@ Q H@@ Q &apos; .
&apos;@@ that is unacceptable and that should never happen &apos; .
Le@@ e , who worked as a lawyer before she was elected in the Senate in 2010 , said that such leakage is a &apos; crime , a very serious federal crime &apos; .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou should not and should not be accompanied by only a dis@@ mis@@ sal , but also a criminal procedure , given that there are classified information about the &apos; , war &apos; .
Mr Ne@@ ws said that at this stage , the report on justice can give an account of what the Ministry of Justice hopes to achieve , not to clarify specific procedures .
last week , President S@@ es@@ ta , President S@@ es@@ ta , was critici@@ zed by President S@@ es@@ ta and in the wrong way out of its an@@ ger , by claiming that the latter have not made enough effort to find le@@ ak@@ kers .
&apos;@@ I want the General Pro@@ secu@@ tive to be a lot of fu@@ n le@@ aks that come to the security agencies &apos; , said to be a ro@@ gue on 25 July .
in S@@ es@@ si@@ s , the previous week , F@@ o@@ x Ne@@ ws , Mr Ne@@ w@@ s@@ on , has admitted that he is not satisfied with the le@@ xi@@ bility that has repeatedly been putting obstacles to the President since his in@@ au@@ ction , with the efforts that have been made .
&apos;@@ I have not been satisfied with earlier proceedings and investigations , &apos; I said &apos; .
even some of the presid@@ ents , even some of the President , have spoken against the silence , saying that such a practice is damaging to foreign policy efforts .
the issue of the question of the speech between the President and the Head of State of Foreign Affairs is an outrageous , shocking and dangerous &apos; , Mr David f@@ ru@@ m was written on Thursday .
&apos;@@ It is extremely important for the President to be able to communicate the confidenti@@ al - and perhaps even more important - that the leaders of the foreign states understand that they will be able to answer a confidentiality &apos; .
the Sen@@ ator Mar@@ k W@@ ara ( D@@ a V@@ a ) , the Senate security committee , said to the B@@ e@@ t@@ t B@@ e@@ as@@ i also said &apos; absolutely &apos; the &apos; absolutely &apos; worrying and con@@ g@@ ress should be investigated .
the US na@@ val of the United States was ordered to remove a box of the post-@@ American flag in the surroun@@ ds of the American flag .
Mr President , the US flag and F@@ l@@ ori@@ da owners are at the heart of the dispute with the flag of the United States of America .
Er@@ us John A@@ ck@@ er@@ t says that he received a letter from the Union of the S@@ ou@@ dar@@ ner L@@ ord last week , in which he is asked to remove or face a box flag in a state flag .
he said to the W@@ C@@ T@@ V@@ s that he is not going down without win@@ ning and has fi@@ led appeals .
&apos;@@ view it honestly as a &apos; I said &apos; said &apos; , Mr A@@ ck@@ er@@ t &apos; .
and I think that people should fight in any form , especially so as to do so .
Mr A@@ ck@@ er@@ t said that the Union of hom@@ e-@@ holders is not in line with its post-@@ S@@ ou@@ than@@ es@@ tic values .
the United States &apos; na@@ val of L@@ o@@ ck@@ er@@ t John A@@ ck@@ er@@ t in the war in the United States , Mr John A@@ ck@@ er@@ t , is to withdraw him in his in@@ augu@@ ral of the post-@@ American economy .
as a result of the end of the &apos; P@@ y@@ ra@@ de@@ season approach &apos; , we are asking you to remove the &apos; yes &apos; to the American flag &apos; , conve@@ yed the letter .
the beau@@ ty could be out of 30 days before and must be deduc@@ ted after at the latest in 15 days at the latest .
he said that four years have been outside .
that was in 30 days &apos; time after the house moving .
the messages for the Union of the S@@ ou@@ dar@@ wa housing community did not receive an immediate answer on Thursday morning .
some A@@ ck@@ er@@ t &apos;s neighbour said that the letter was a little harsh , and they were not surprised by the activity of the owners of the owners of the Union .
&apos;@@ L@@ ike Ste@@ p@@ h@@ en@@ son said such things .
I think that is ridiculous .
why should it not be patri@@ otic in our own country ?
the M@@ en P@@ A@@ T@@ EL said : &apos; it is a ve@@ ter@@ ans who served our country .
this is simply a flag from a flag .
I do not think that this is right .
the house belongs to him , at least it could be allowed .
it is stated in the Union that it has been said that the A@@ ck@@ er@@ t has 15 days to remove the around 15 days , otherwise it will be expected to be fine .
he has not received an answer to his appeal .

the report : Mr Mu@@ el@@ ler called for an investigation into the whole of the elderly in the investigation of Russia .
the S@@ tre@@ et J@@ our@@ nal announced on Thursday that Russia and the D@@ on@@ al@@ d P@@ on@@ al@@ d Pro@@ secu@@ tive Pro@@ secu@@ tive Pro@@ secu@@ tive ties have called for a total of the entire public prosecu@@ tor .
the co@@ w states that a new and significant step forward in the investigation of Mr Mu@@ el@@ ler &apos;s investi@@ g@@ ators is a new and significant step forward in the investigation of the Special Pro@@ secu@@ tive Pro@@ secu@@ tive Pro@@ secu@@ tive , Mr Mu@@ el@@ ler &apos;s investi@@ g@@ ators , whether or his main ad@@ vis@@ ors were negotiated with Moscow to promote the presidential presidential campaign in 201@@ 6 .
Mr Ne@@ ws Ne@@ ws Ne@@ ws has announced that , before Mu@@ el@@ ler , a director of Mr Mu@@ el@@ ler , who now leads this critical investigation , appointed by state prosecu@@ tors Michael F@@ l@@ y@@ n@@ n , Mr F@@ l@@ y@@ n and the former campaign leader , Mr F@@ l@@ y@@ n and the former campaign of the former campaign leader , Mr F@@ l@@ y@@ n , has used to be used as part of the investigation of the former campaign by Mr F@@ l@@ y@@ n .
one of the President &apos;s personal lawyers , John D@@ O@@ W@@ O@@ W@@ D , said to N@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws that he was not aware that Mr Mu@@ el@@ ler has started the entire use of the elderly .
&apos;@@ We have worked with Mr Mu@@ el@@ ler and his team since 1 June , because we want to have it to one side &apos; , he said .
in the light of the news of the entire gathering of f@@ ed@@ eral@@ ist men , there is no reason for us to think that the President is under investigation &apos; .
Mr Ne@@ ws Ne@@ ws Ne@@ ws have not confirmed the data of J@@ our@@ n@@ al .
the whole use of the old child is a normal part of a complex investigation and is not a tool designed only to listen to the testi@@ mon@@ ies , but also to obtain information and data acquisition from individual or businesses .
it is a powerful tool , which prosecu@@ tors may use to use charges and trials , and this may be referred to that the work of Mr Mu@@ el@@ ler is still far from being done .
you have denied the fact that he or any member of his team in the period for the period 201@@ 6 took a plan with Russia .
Moscow &apos;s officials have also denied the role of playing a tru@@ mp in the last year in November last year .
the President of the President has said that he was not aware that Mr Mu@@ el@@ ler has started the entire use of the new grand@@ de@@ sc@@ end@@ ants .

the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ th Bank Com@@ Australia Bank is charged with excessive money la@@ undering .
the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an Government has presented an indic@@ tment of money la@@ undering and anti-@@ terrorist rules on Thursday , in the country &apos;s largest mortgage on Thursday .
the F@@ U@@ S@@ T@@ R@@ A@@ C public has revealed that they have initiated a civil sentence against the Com@@ m@@ ali@@ k of the &apos; serious and systematic failure &apos; against Australia as a result of the &apos; serious and systematic lack of compliance &apos; in Australia as a result of the so-called &apos; serious and systematic lack of compliance &apos; in Australia , and in the first case where the accused is a big bank .
&apos;@@ Com@@ m@@ Bank &apos;s behaviour in this matter has left the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an society to a serious and lasting financial crime in the case of the A@@ U@@ S@@ T@@ R@@ A@@ C case .
Com@@ mon@@ we@@ th Bank in its statement in its statement that they are looking into a closer and proper manner , &apos; when the time is right &apos; .
Australia &apos;s largest mortgage was not given &apos; time &apos; in time &apos; time , or &apos; no &apos; to &apos; knowledge &apos; about &apos; suspect &apos; , &apos; concerning transactions for more than USD 77 million &apos; , announced the A@@ U@@ S@@ T@@ RA@@ C .
according to the agency , the Bank has committed 53 700 money la@@ undering and violation of the act against the financing of terrorism , especially with regard to so-called intelligent in@@ solvency .
the last biggest type of such type of type of type of type of type of type of type of type of type of type of type of type of type of type of type of type of type of type was linked to the Hol@@ y , Tab@@ c@@ or@@ p Hol@@ der of Australia in the past year , who had just 108 violations of
the Tab@@ c@@ or@@ p cost a fine of 45 million to the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an dollar , and it is the largest civil penalty in the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an corporate history .
the A@@ U@@ C representative has refused to comment on the possible sentence of the Com@@ m@@ Bank , or whether there may be other banks .
the maximum penalty for money la@@ undering and anti-@@ funding law in the event of a law of anti-@@ terrorism is 18 million for breaches of Australia .
intelligent in@@ solvency mach@@ ines are a specific type of bank au@@ part@@ om@@ ies that are adopted in the form of both cash and a che@@ que and facilitate the anon@@ y@@ mit@@ y payments of cash .
according to the A@@ U@@ C , the use of intelligent in@@ solvency au@@ ctions is , after all , a significant increase in the use of the Com@@ m@@ Bank in May 2012 .
the in@@ jec@@ tion of cash contributions from 201@@ 6 to the June six months last six months to USD 89 billion , compared with USD 89 million in the first six months after the Com@@ m@@ Bank , took place in the first six months .
the A@@ U@@ S@@ T@@ R@@ A@@ C claims in court documents that the cash contributions were made from counterfeit names , so that the income for drug imports is a ship .
&apos;@@ even after the case of the Com@@ m@@ Bank &apos;s attention to be tra@@ cked into money la@@ undering or &apos; F@@ oo@@ f@@ f@@ k accounts &apos; , the Com@@ m@@ Bank did not start to monitor its cli@@ ents in order to make it difficult and manage the financing of money la@@ undering and terrorism &apos; , show legal documents .
in the A@@ U@@ S@@ T@@ R@@ A@@ C , the Com@@ m@@ Bank accounts were also used to &apos; ba@@ il &apos; , it is a form of money la@@ undering which involves transfers between countries without money , in actual fact , without money being transferred to international borders .
two influential women share their success in their success .
what are Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an@@ on and La@@ ila A@@ les ?
at first sight , these women are from two different parts of the world .
to New York , Bar@@ us@@ ta Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an , a USD 1 billion worth of five billion worth five billion worth , before implementing his expertise in the A@@ B@@ C serious , the A@@ B@@ C &apos;s serious &apos; S@@ ho@@ k Tan@@ k &apos; , the &apos; S@@ as@@ k Tan@@ k &apos; , the A@@ B@@ C &apos;s serious &apos; S@@ port &apos; pan@@ el .
Mrs Ali has been going on in its father by becoming a four@@ -@@ win che@@ que to be the most successful female po@@ cket , before the addi@@ cts of his success@@ ors , the author and the roles of the author , the author of the author and the speaker .
in spite of their unique career routes ( or perhaps , in the name of T@@ J Ma@@ x@@ x , both women , in T@@ J , would be able to talk about the re@@ ot@@ y@@ ping of re@@ ot@@ y@@ re@@ ot@@ y@@ ping and achieving ambitious goals .
last year , it talked to the hundreds of the hundreds of the hundreds of the hundreds of women in T@@ .@@ J@@ . Ma@@ x@@ x , that 80 % of them feel that society has given them a clear division of roles and expectations .
consequently , they came from the Ma@@ x@@ x Y@@ ou Pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t to help women to break down these barriers .
Mr Cor@@ c@@ or@@ is and Mr Ali know a great deal about this ; they may still be at the top of their own area , but the road was not to be s@@ m@@ oo@@ ther for both of them .
Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an received at secondary school and in the College , mainly D@@ -@@ 2 and had been working for 20 years now in the 20 jobs .
it was one of the most male areas of the most male area and , in addition , she faced a challenge to try and get his father of the property who were over@@ stret@@ ched .
those two mil@@ len@@ tly , in order to put them mil@@ dly , are sha@@ king through the knowledge they have acquired .
we have therefore been lagging behind with these influential women in order to talk about exceeding failings , success of success and their sense of trust in business and relations .
what is insp@@ iring you to do what you are doing every day ?
Mrs Ali : I insp@@ ire my personal goals every day .
I have formed the ha@@ bit of what I wish to achieve .
and I am looking at this list .
I consider myself to be responsible .
I will , of course , insp@@ ire my children .
my ambitions will insp@@ ire me .
I would like to be a victory for everything that I will be alive .
I realise that achieving my goals will be hard to work , but I am prepared to do so .
my self-@@ confidence comes from the preparation .
so I will take a great deal of time on the preparation .
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an , as Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an , is a key preparation for my confidence , but I will not draw inspiration from it .
in fact , I am inspired by the e@@ lep@@ h@@ ant cu@@ ri@@ o@@ sity .
what will happen if I do so ?
what will remain , if I do not do so ?
this cu@@ ri@@ o@@ sity leads me to rise in the morning because I cannot wait for what the day entails .
if , on some days , I do not know , I am preten@@ ding that I am preten@@ ding that I am preten@@ ding .
I will then believe my own b@@ reat@@ h , and I will be inspired again .
talk about some of the obstacles in your career , which made you better in the long run .
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an , for me , it was the hardest to my business partner , and my secre@@ tari@@ es were mar@@ ried in mar@@ ried .
I have completed the year later , but this year - fif@@ thly - was horri@@ ble because I did not have enough confidence in order to leave .
I felt myself in the absence of any kind of inspiration .
but amaz@@ ing is what happens .
it is hardest to believe in this moments when you are hit by set@@ backs .
it was extremely difficult for us to go on their own feet and again from scra@@ t@@ ch on the back of the business .
Mrs Ali : I say that my career was the most difficult time when I dealt with my career , I was at the top of my career and decided to introduce divorce .
I was not only separated from my hus@@ band , but also from the customs memor@@ ies and someone who taught me everything I know about the po@@ pp@@ y .
I did not believe that I can manage .
so I started to be concerned about the future of my career , and I had to find time to take a step back and to say : &apos; you all need the necessary knowledge and experience &apos; .
they are all in the po@@ x of their experience .
you will certainly be able to do so &apos; .
so I formed a new team and resumed my career .
in fact , it was simply necessary to achieve the right idea , because the rest was there .
I did what I had to do , I had to face fear and dare to get rid of our spo@@ ts and memory , and to continue with your career .
when did you felt that you really have achieved success ?
Mrs Ali : I felt that I have succeeded when I won the title of my first champi@@ on@@ ship .
this was a really good feeling , because I wanted to be one of the best , it was not to be un@@ be@@ arable .
I have been able to achieve this and I did not win the title of champi@@ ons , but on four occasions .
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : one moment when I felt that I have achieved success , was in my 11 years of action .
I was at the end of the day .
I was supposed to be a profit of around USD 42 000 , which I was not able to wait .
I went out straight away , and I bought a new car on both the mother and fathers ; they never had a new car , and I have never been a new car , and I have been able to get cars to F@@ l@@ or@@ id@@ a , where they felt their own retirement .
I felt myself like the Qu@@ e@@ en of England .
I felt myself .
I have a lot of service in the coming years in the coming years , but nothing has been able to offer the same sense as an opportunity to give their parents something back and to striking them with surprise .
how have you been able to keep ourselves motivated by this 1@@ 1-@@ year-old period to keep working ?
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an , I did not measure my business according to profits because it was not my intention .
I just wanted to see how far I can get .
I have already set myself on the first day the dream of the sitting of New York .
and I saw herself as a P@@ ope as a P@@ ope - all of my war and che@@ ese me .
I had such a little idea in my dece@@ it .
so , when I increasingly try every single day , every hour , I did not actually think about the money .
finally , I do not live in the service .
but the whole of the money that came into being was focused on business straight away .
I do not even believe that I had any deter@@ rent days at all , where I would have thought that o@@ h God , we do not earn money .
I simply was convinced that something will work .
the worst that could have been the case would have been removed from the company and once again a pretext .
I then have good drin@@ k money and I was happy .
I could be happy again .
for this reason , I do not believe that many progress has been made for the great pursuit of many people .
they have other incentives that are s@@ pur@@ red by them .
and the money was not one of my own .
do you have a few advice to anyone who has such great dre@@ ams , but who hold back the financial factor ?
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : when I was going to get a lot of money , I had the money to invest in property , but I did not have time .
I R@@ i@@ era was a business .
and that is why I find myself five different partners who were not even specialists in the rural world , but in the various neighbour@@ hoo@@ ds in the various neighbour@@ hoo@@ ds , who felt the streets and the gu@@ l@@ l@@ ance .
I am putting them to them and I said : &apos; you know this neighbourhood .
I find the best building .
I will give money and you will be my partner .
the lesson here is that if you have the money , you have the people to earn money with their money .
and when you have tal@@ ent , you can sell it to anyone who has money , and instead to serve money .
there are two aspects here : An@@ ne and money .
but if you are not both together , there is nothing in particular .
in the end , I - and also my partners - have worked very well over all these years , which I would never have had , if I had not had the courage to find the com@@ ba@@ tive people who likes to be .
it is always possible to obtain money if the belief that the summer has tal@@ ent and the senti@@ ments of the world do better than anyone else .
what are these two or three things that you are doing every morning , which will help you succeed ?
Mrs Ali : I do not know about you , but I have a lot of time in life , when I feel over@@ load , having a mother , business , spo@@ use , all of the roles that we are playing by women .
I have reached a point in my life where I really had to put in place this morning .
I like to rise and simply to feel of gratitude .
the gra@@ vity of the up@@ ris@@ ings , their health , their children , their own family .
I am very often calling for what my objectives will be for the next day , if I do not mind , I look again at this list .
we are di@@ visi@@ ve .
I sometimes write to day .
there is always a line of co@@ ff@@ e@@ e .
and always this is the first thing to do , because if I do not do so , it will not do so .
for me , it is ultimately about priorities .
those are things that are important to me : my sp@@ ic@@ ity , concentration on the uni@@ verse and God , then training and putting our health first .
it seems to be quite simple , thanks to that .
I feel that I will be able to un@@ lock all the challenges that come to my way .
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : I shall be consistent with the importance of things .
I will work on a list of tasks which is endless and ridiculous .
and put in place , which is the most important .
what are the real priorities ?
I am trying to accept the most important things they are doing .
what are you doing in order to bring ourselves into the right idea ?
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an , I imagine that he is failing .
it is so cra@@ zy , if it is not .
I mean that the I@@ ss@@ and , I do not .
I am sure , and this puts me more effort .
I imagine anyone who compete with me - I am very com@@ ba@@ tive in nature because I am one of the ten children and we never received enough attention to our parents .
I can be very competitive .
and I will always be too thoroughly prepared .
my self-@@ confidence reinforces my self-@@ confidence .
Mrs Ali : amaz@@ ing how we are in this respect .
we are two successful people and it shows how differently things are working for different people .
I like to imagine that I am successful .
I like to think about the end , which is success .
I imagine this in the spirit of the spirit , I see it in practice .
I see a po@@ pp@@ y of the struggle , the fight to take place and a return to ri@@ i@@ ca@@ id space , a victory of a code of conduct , as I have always done .
the same applies to meetings .
however , I am always preparing itself in a thorough manner , and this self-@@ confidence is precisely because of preparation , because the fear is that I do not go well , or I do not say the right things , or not the information we need .
here is what the preparation of the game is preparing for me .
however , I always enter the final result .
you have both been very successful in your career .
how will you pass on that ?
Mrs Ali : I am very exc@@ iting that I can be part of Mr Y@@ ou Pro@@ j@@ ec@@ t , because I feel that this is an opportunity to do good .
there is a great many women who need to insp@@ ire , encourage them to strive for their dre@@ ams and objectives .
there is a blan@@ k che@@ que .
it is , in fact , a demonstration and to have the necessary tools , with the right people in his surrounding , with the people who have been able to achieve things that you are trying to achieve .
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : one of the things I do , I think is very well inspired by the people .
I was therefore very ex@@ cited when I was asked to cooperate with Ma@@ x@@ x Y@@ ou Pro@@ ject .
I will try to take the light of indi@@ vi@@ du@@ ality and inspiration from what we see in all these people &apos;s faces , and to give them practical advice on how to move forward .
many people are going to get started with their dre@@ ams , but tend to be mistaken in some respects .
so we are trying to help them focus on their target .
everything we taught us is practical .
there is a business planning , even so simple , such as the li@@ f@@ tic speech , everything that is needed to e@@ rec@@ t a business .
what would you give to women who wish to make progress in central areas ?
Mrs Ali : I am acting in one area in the most male area , which is a po@@ cket .
to come from our father , who was the world &apos;s ic@@ ies and the best of all times , was quite de@@ cep@@ tible .
for me , it was actually the essence of this tal@@ ent , courage , strength .
the first thing I had to believe was to believe that I can stand up and be successful .
at the time , no one else did not have any restrictions on my way , but I did not have any restrictions on those that I myself had in their own to@@ ol@@ box .
if you believe to ourselves and find their passion , nobody can stop you .
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : the road will be inspired and in my way in my own form of attitude - &apos; the ca@@ ke of the &apos; New York es@@ ca@@ ping &apos; - and there is a huge amount of long way between exceeding the re@@ fin@@ ing line .
and there are many tal@@ ents in this interim phase , which is a daily job in a career every day .
there will be no need to act with ob@@ ses@@ sion in order to need these tal@@ ents .
I am sure that , in the area of La@@ ila , it was also necessary to decide what the right people are right , the correct memor@@ ies when we start to stop when a lot of money can be put in place that can be put in place , which is not how hard it is prepared to work on .
these are all subjec@@ tive decisions .
I will try to make them a little more reli@@ ance on making sure that these women really feel : &apos; no &apos; , I now understand .
let me try .
here , my three priorities are &apos; .
if they are to leave three main priorities , so that things really materi@@ alise , I am going to return at home at home .
what are you at the moment in your night ?
Mrs Ali : too many tri@@ cky .
ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ines , books , small me@@ wine , my day .
it is likely to be on water .
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an , I have a little green light on my night , because I tried to break the ha@@ bit of a review every morning .
that is why I have obtained it .
that was a doctor .
but it has never worked .
and is still there .
and my phone is still on my night .
what are you going to read at the moment ?
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : E@@ igh@@ th or N@@ in@@ th order to win friends and to influence the people &apos; .
that will keep me on the right track .
I believe that this is still the best one that has been written in this area , a distinction that is not what is forgotten , which is not the dre@@ ams of the dre@@ ams , which cannot be achieved without other people .
and this will be possible to communicate in exactly the same way as in the past .
I like to read it time from time to time .
this will help me again to get on the right path .
Mrs Ali : learning at school , which is why I shall read the book on the &apos; N@@ O@@ L@@ I &apos; .
it talks about the eating of cereals and how we have a body of ours .
that is an interest I am very interested in .
what is your best advice to manage the failings and failings ?
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : ignore the ba@@ si@@ cs .
they meet all sorts of different images .
they have to remove their own words .
let us keep away from the vi@@ ers .
they are mira@@ cul@@ ous to energy .
I am thinking of the vi@@ ric@@ s as early as property .
they will come to night , they are wal@@ king your money and leaving them .
the pessimis@@ ts destroy any team in a team more quickly than you can look at the eyes because people who are ru@@ ining themselves want to feel badly felt by others .
they are attra@@ cting good people together with themselves .
I can avoid all the negative people of the negative people of 50 km , because my aim is to be positive and to take all the best of life , and to give all I have to offer .
so why should I want to spend a minute on those people ?
Mrs Ali : it must be consistent .
let us start with conviction that we are now taking this path .
we are doing this , and that is what we are doing .
but people do not follow it long enough .
they sometimes give them just before when it comes to over the last fuel .
so I think it is necessary to stay on the path .
when the senti@@ ments to do with something , you have been consistent .
and to make a severe work that requires success .
Mrs Cor@@ c@@ or@@ an : a great deal of consistency must be made to ensure continuity .
do you know what is needed for this ?
completion of things .
if you start something , it will be finished .
many are the founding fathers , but not , in particular , to stop .
Chinese anti-@@ Chinese cen@@ sors play a complex c@@ run@@ ch and mo@@ use .
according to the experts , a shift that may affect a lot of users from researchers to businesses , that China is increasingly aware of the influence of the internet .
&apos;@@ it seems that the restrictions are becoming ever more intensively , but at the same time the internet is more powerful than ever , Mrs Par@@ ker , who has written a book on the &apos; no@@ w I K@@ no@@ w A@@ re &apos; , which deals with the influence of the internet in China , Cuba and Russia .
the restrictions imposed on Beijing &apos;s Internet are the equ@@ ation in China with the effect of the internet .
the experts have not yet strengthened the control of China and , in many cases , a continuation and a mo@@ use game will continue .
one day after the A@@ pp@@ le , last week , people started to spread the Chinese social media in order to gain access to those tools that are so simple that it is even at a technical level .
it involved the registration of a person &apos;s applications to another country in which the V@@ P@@ N@@ -@@ applications applications are still available .
nevertheless , Thursday , it shows that China wants to change the benefits of the game .
a number of Chinese Internet providers said on its social media accounts on Thursday on Thursday , websites , or in the reports that Chinese security officials are testing a new way to find a new way of getting the online addresses of their services , which ho@@ sts or use illegal content .
when they have been reached , the authorities are asking that Internet service providers require an end to their cli@@ ents .
if cli@@ ents continue , inter@@ rup@@ ting service providers and Chinese officials from their Community minutes .
the public security Ministry did not reply to a comment on the matter .
studies suggest that tens of millions of millions of people from V@@ P@@ N and hundreds of millions of sof@@ tw@@ are in China are being used to escape from a high fire .
although foreign television broadcas@@ ts and por@@ no@@ graph@@ ic blo@@ ts are excluded from many people , they will make them an enormous challenge for the Internet users of the Internet for Internet users .
the President of China X@@ I J@@ in@@ ning has been responsible for the new control of the internet over the years , but she has also highlighted the technology and the internet as a critical factor in the future economic development of China .
since cyber@@ space has started to play a more central role in the whole of China , the government control has evol@@ ved .
it is difficult to clarify the scope of the new efforts , because many users and businesses are not discussing them publicly , fe@@ aring in fear of the paraly@@ sis of the Chinese Government .
however , some frequent users have said that it is becoming increasingly difficult to escape from restrictions .
one student who is stu@@ dying in the United States and the summer holiday in China , said that the local V@@ P@@ N has been blocked .
he said that he took this period as a kind of kind of me@@ thane from the social media , and she failed to send a message to his friends in F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k to explain why she has been under the ground .
in Chinese one school in the environmental doc@@ toral of the University of China , it said that without Google , ITER has become more difficult , even though the University has found alternative prin@@ ted prin@@ ted prin@@ ters so that pupils should not always have the internet .
it has now been said that he has now found a new way in which to by@@ pass the big fire , without public dis@@ closed with which it is .
according to Chinese observers of Internet observers , some V@@ P@@ N still operate and China would still have much more to do in order to intensify restrictions .
&apos;@@ We believe that , if the government had decided to do so , it would have been used much more about the use of the V@@ P@@ N@@ -@@ Da@@ da , a website set up in 2015 , which will help Chinese users to find a job , a representative .
&apos;@@ if the government had sent out more , it would be much more difficult for the Chinese , who refused to call himself in China because of the sensitivity of the group of work .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou did not do so , because they have to leave people or businesses a little brea@@ thing space &apos; .
China &apos;s online restrictions are often cy@@ cli@@ cal .
the current atmosphere is partly due to the imminent importance of the Chinese Communist Party , which is the 19@@ th Congress in the autumn of the autumn .
five years ago , the V@@ P@@ N@@ -@@ before meeting was hit by un@@ foreseeable disrup@@ tions at the time .
as economic policy or external affairs , censorship in China is also part of a complex and often defici@@ ent political process .
according to analy@@ sts , government minis@@ tries in the run-up to Congress feel that they are effective and able to intervene in the event of a problem .
&apos;@@ therefore , it is certainly not in the A@@ po@@ cal@@ s &apos; a@@ po@@ cal@@ y@@ sis &apos; , the E@@ u@@ ra@@ sia G@@ ro@@ p leader , Mr Tri@@ ol@@ o , leader of the global technological depart@@ ment .
the more complex environment for users of users and new opportunities and approaches will allow China to simply better use certain parts of V@@ P@@ N@@ -@@ used use in Beijing and include &apos; , he said .
the Chinese population will learn from their difficulties with their difficulties .
in the past summer , China &apos;s Internet T@@ en T@@ en@@ c@@ ka began to limit the time , which has been allowed to be used for the young people of the Internet on the Internet , enabling it to make an hour a day for those who are younger than 12 , and two hours for those aged between 12 , and two hours .
for this reason , Chinese young people have started to use every single solution - counterfeit documents .
&apos;@@ Mr K@@ ing &apos;s &apos; a &apos; ch@@ on@@ or of &apos; toys &apos; ?
are you interested in obtaining a document , which shows that you are older than 18 ? &apos; the recent advertising in the social media in China &apos; asked .

the M@@ o@@ ther@@ bo@@ v@@ bo@@ ard announced on Thursday that Hu@@ t@@ és was in the L@@ as V@@ al@@ at airport after the week , B@@ la@@ ck H@@ at and D@@ ef@@ c@@ is &apos;s visit .
he had plans to fly back home in Britain .
the Tur@@ ke@@ community community reacted with a lack of amaz@@ ing and scepticism .
some warned that the requirements against Hu@@ t@@ chin@@ si may undermine the relationship between &apos; white &apos; , researchers , who are looking for the weak points of sof@@ tw@@ are to identify and resolve problems , not for committing crimes or chaos , and between enforcement bodies .
others had the hesi@@ tant view of the fact that Hu@@ t@@ ch could be an attack on such sof@@ tw@@ are .
in July 2014 , he asked T@@ wit@@ ter@@ n , and no one is not a w@@ ron@@ o@@ se , which is a strange request when he himself was the author of the no@@ table .
although the precise details of the High Hu@@ t@@ chin@@ ians K@@ ron@@ o@@ se are not clear , market numbers are often ignored in the search for vulnerable parts of the computer .
in the last few years , major technical companies have set out &apos; errors &apos; money &apos; in order to form@@ alise the problems for researchers and compensation for their work .
at a conference in D@@ ef@@ con@@ i , market restrictions from all over the world have also been a ten@@ se relationship with the law enforcement agencies .
in 2002 , F@@ B@@ I , the F@@ B@@ I , has been arrested following the Russian k@@ r@@ h@@ a ho@@ tel in L@@ as , when she had had a sof@@ tw@@ are , which would have been able to undermine certain types of e-@@ books safety in the hands of the authorities .
the E@@ le@@ c@@ tron@@ ic F@@ ron@@ ti@@ er F@@ ron@@ ti@@ er Fron@@ ti@@ er said in his statement that the arrest of Hu@@ t@@ chin@@ s and is looking into a closer look at the matter .
Mr W@@ ind@@ ow@@ o@@ ws , the parents of W@@ ind@@ ow@@ o@@ w W@@ ind@@ ow@@ o@@ ws , were infected by the parents of Mr W@@ ind@@ o@@ ws .

in an inter@@ view given to the Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ e in May , the Hu@@ t@@ és said that he recorded online ownership after it discovered that the m@@ ali@@ cious sof@@ tw@@ are is trying to establish this .
by regis@@ tering a 10@@ .@@ 69 dollar , she started the so-called killing phase , which suspended the spread of sof@@ tw@@ are .

Wales asked him to come to an inter@@ lo@@ cu@@ tor for the creation and his post of the newspaper in T@@ is@@ ne@@ y@@ l@@ and Ne@@ ws .
Wales said that the subject will soon be opened .
and that is what it needs .
in writing . - ( DE ) Mr President , in Wales , he had 20 minutes of inter@@ views .
however , the S@@ glass was also meant to prove that he knows what he does .
&apos;@@ I was working there for two weeks and I had to present a concept of W@@ al@@ ne@@ y D@@ is@@ ne@@ y , he reminded him in the in@@ augu@@ ral of D@@ is@@ ne@@ y A@@ ven@@ u@@ e on the D@@ is@@ ne@@ y A@@ ven@@ ue site .
&apos;@@ if it had not liked to Wales , he would have thrown me out of the door and that it has been ex@@ pelled by the door .
fortunately , it was a pleasure for Wales .
I was 21 .
this was frigh@@ tening .
I never had been working at a professional level &apos; .
the S@@ glass in S@@ k@@ on@@ y D@@ is@@ ne@@ y ( and also a few other people ) at one point in M@@ k 10 would , at one point , &apos; M@@ k 10 &apos; , the subject of the subject to a matter of directors of directors .
the orders include , for example , the same as the feeling of my target .
I am trying to &apos; take the sho@@ ts &apos; in the hands of visitors &apos; in order to experience the at@@ ro@@ cious as they are .
in the case of any at@@ ro@@ ss@@ ing , it is only one of the story .

it is left behind its spo@@ use , ne@@ i@@ u@@ ne@@ -@@ ven@@ e , Le@@ a@@ h Ger@@ ber , a po@@ et Ho@@ w@@ ard and four children .
S@@ glass was a committed leader of D@@ is@@ ne@@ y .
he has regularly delivered three of the M@@ ik@@ -@@ Hi@@ ire clo@@ ck , which showed him time in L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les , Paris and T@@ o@@ k@@ y@@ o ) and the M@@ ik@@ i Hi@@ ire gol@@ den war .
and he never forgotten anything that W@@ se D@@ is@@ ne@@ y had taught him .
when D@@ is@@ ne@@ y S@@ pan@@ y was doctors of C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia in C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia , the S@@ k@@ r Plan was reminded of the actions that parents and children can jointly do , as Mr D@@ is@@ ne@@ y had called for .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou all reminded everyone that he was at all because Wales was a practice to bring its da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters Di@@ se , Mr Di@@ ana and S@@ har@@ on@@ i G@@ ri@@ ff@@ i@@ th , in the Times in L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les in 2002 , he said in the Times in L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les in 2002 , &apos; and fathers had to sit in a par@@ k and a cor@@ ner to eat and to eat a par@@ k and bo@@ y to eat , until children were on their own . .
he thought that he felt that he had a good sense of interest .
why did his symp@@ toms were so different ?
on the Tra@@ u@@ land point , a great deal was given to a s@@ mi@@ le at@@ na@@ fe@@ en in order to humili@@ ate it .
during the rest of the day , he was inter@@ viewed , a storm that was inter@@ viewed , was sor@@ ted and investigated .
none of this has shown anything , but he was not being sent to the home .
he understood the reason .
for the past two years , it was the medicine called e@@ than@@ ol called &apos; e@@ than@@ g@@ ren@@ h &apos; .
the cure reduces the capacity of immun@@ e systems and it is bi@@ ased on its capacity to combat defec@@ tive .
Mrs S@@ j@@ ö@@ gre@@ n is a dis@@ orders - quite a my@@ ster@@ y disease where the body of its own gu@@ n v@@ ines is attacking normal , as if it were an in@@ sur@@ gency organ@@ ism in this case , which is in the face of te@@ ars and heart , as well as in some species .
every week &apos;s e@@ than@@ ol e@@ than@@ ol had helped , by reducing his excessive pain .
but he knew that , because of this medicinal product , he was quite decent in the event of a serious infection .
if the at@@ om@@ ic min@@ o@@ fe@@ en started , the patient felt much better .
Mr Tra@@ u@@ ma@@ ic &apos;s doctors decided to leave the night to hospital .
when it comes to the virus , as doctors suspect , she will be in order with him next day and she will be allowed to go home .
if , for the first time , the first time of its new patients in the six months , he has led herself to the defec@@ tive , to which the e@@ than@@ ol man is rece@@ p@@ tive .
that list was long .
it is not the case that the diagnosis cannot be treated before the diagnosis , and therefore it focused on the bac@@ teri@@ a .
one of the bac@@ teri@@ a , which is attacking people with immunity , is a kind of extra measure on food .
this is often found in un@@ pas@@ sa@@ ble milk and che@@ ese , and this causes terrible i@@ i@@ i@@ i@@ vel@@ ation , c@@ oo@@ king and s@@ lot , which he did not see .
the Le@@ e@@ gi@@ on@@ -@@ business disease is a second infection that has spread among the pro@@ pri@@ ts of this medicinal product , but it did not have the cl@@ oud or the lack of air .
the even more widespread bac@@ k@@ h@@ y@@ los au@@ c@@ se au@@ c@@ tiveness may cause excessive defec@@ ts , but again , he did not have excessive complaints .
in spite of this , the intention is to start a large deal of antibio@@ tic treatment , which would cover all these risks .
however , when it came to the patient , it did not feel that he could get lab@@ ori@@ ous in the hands of a serious infection .
doctors in Tra@@ u@@ ma@@ ic point were not an antibio@@ tic .
doctors had the opportunity to dra@@ g on with the man@@ if@@ est of antibiotics and simply to monitor and wait , but if the patient had been one of the defec@@ ts that she had read , the treatment even a few hours would result in death .
it was even more difficult to see the fact that the patient thought the patient thought it is an aller@@ gic line , although she did not remember what happened when she took it .
this was created by the risk and the benefits of the relationship .
traditionally , the decision on whether or not to start treatment will change will change if its consequences may be so dangerous .
he asked for a colleague , a patient , a patient .
Mr G@@ ir@@ ard did not say to my colleague that he is in a position to look at the treatment of antibiotics , and he asked simply to review the patient and to give his recommendation .
my colleague met the patient and agreed .
although it was well known , it would be virtually un@@ defen@@ sible in the event of an infection .
the doctor should be antibiotics in the patient .
since the patient has been affected by the patient , the G@@ ir@@ ard should be allowed to testing him in order to check whether he is be@@ a@@ ten to a medicinal product that is not a pen@@ it@@ ant , but close to the relatives .
Mr G@@ ir@@ ard asked for the the@@ sis .
if he had a serious reaction to the medicinal products , he would have come about or his blood pressure would have been down@@ gra@@ ded .
neither happened .
for this reason , he was called into a holistic do@@ g .
a few hours later , Mr G@@ ir@@ ard was an speech .
the patient &apos;s own temper@@ atures had 39 degrees .
he has has@@ tened the patient .
at the hel@@ m of the patient , there was a s@@ mi@@ le la@@ yer , and he was the Roma .
although he seems to be un@@ comfortable , he was in his heart and with the blood of blood .
I congratulate the doctor to express the fact that she had been antibiotics in the patient .
he has asked for a further do@@ g T@@ y@@ len@@ oli and , if she had to look over the last time , it is deeply in May .
the fe@@ ver had withdrawn .
H@@ ig@@ ine and Roma have disappeared .
next evening , when Mr G@@ ir@@ ard was involved in a hospital in a hospital , he visited the patient as a first .
she has also adopted five other patients , but for this patient , at home , at home , at home , at home , at home , Mr G@@ ir@@ ard , at home , was the most concerned about his topical team .
during those hours when she did not see him , his blood was an increase in the body of his blood .
it was too early to say what it is more precise .
it was clear , however , that this is a bac@@ teri@@ a that is strong enough to grow quickly in order to grow quickly , and that it is not a col@@ lusion or a fi@@ x@@ on@@ ic disease .
there was a long list of other possibilities , and none of them actually seen appropriate .
it took a further two days before they finally managed to identify the bac@@ teri@@ a .
this was an additional assis@@ tant .
Mr G@@ ir@@ ard , as well as anyone who looked after the patient , were surprised .
as a doctor , pic@@ tures on disease are pic@@ ked up .
for the G@@ ir@@ ds , there was a disease that would result from un@@ pas@@ sa@@ ble milk and soft talk , and which causes i@@ i@@ i@@ vel@@ ine , c@@ oo@@ k and di@@ ligence .
she has worked even further on this unusual infection , and it felt that , although people in the usual immun@@ e system may experience their symp@@ toms , they usually quickly recover as a patient colleague .
pregnant women , parents , between men and 65 and the immun@@ e system of the immun@@ e system , can un@@ le@@ ash away outside , but sometimes the usual symp@@ toms - and would be in blood in blood .
it can spread over the whole of the whole body as the cost .
this type of defec@@ tive , which is called &apos; in@@ st@@ inc@@ t &apos; , could result in the case of up to 30 % of cases of death in cases of suff@@ e@@ rers .
indeed , although it is not so widespread as a bo@@ as@@ y@@ man , the same death can be the same as dead@@ ly .
early antibio@@ tic treatment can save life .
if it is a food@@ stu@@ ff disease , what food was provided by the bac@@ teri@@ a ?
although the patient and his colleague did not have been consumed by the passenger and the w@@ oo@@ den che@@ ese , Internet search was identified in the summer of this summer in Scotland , which was linked to smo@@ ke@@ led beef .
neither of them had been smo@@ ke@@ red beef , but they have a little smo@@ kes@@ cre@@ en slightly .
where the bac@@ teri@@ a has been repeating the bac@@ teri@@ um , there was no secret .
when the doctors &apos; team had learnt , which is a mistake for the patient , they were able to adapt antibiotics .
his three-@@ week treatment ended in July .
doctors recommended to the end of the summer , but he is now feel very well and has returned to the mu@@ se@@ um and their bel@@ o@@ ved work .
Pakistan &apos;s price in India cannot find refuge in India .
70 years after the history of the history of the two countries , the greatest history of the history of the history of the history of the history goes to India .
there are tens of thousands of people who are already in the wake of the two countries &apos; border , who do not even have the legal right to work in India .
so many other options are not just as bo@@ gged down in the fib@@ re pressure close to temporary habi@@ ta@@ ts , on the other hand , the Indian authorities are monitoring the movements of the border , on the other hand , very closely .
the majority of Pakistan will not be able to wait for such reception .
there is no work , there is no money , there is no money .
we worked there on the fields , we were be@@ a@@ po@@ ters .
here , however , we are being forced to break the ba@@ g &apos; , in a war of 8@@ -@@ year-old J@@ og@@ as .
for us , division is not over .
the prices are still trying to return to their country .
and when they come here , they do not have anything &apos; , including close to the city of Jo@@ d@@ h@@ eru@@ r , near the city of Jo@@ d@@ h@@ eru@@ w .
after India &apos;s independence from British colonial power in 19@@ 47 , over 15 million people lost their homes .
the allocation was caused by the wave of violence in a period of months , which lost at least one million people because of religious an@@ ger .
in the bloody chaos , the brea@@ d and si@@ ck@@ ens of the new@@ ly-@@ formed Pakistan , Muslims were in the opposite direction .
in spite of the emig@@ ration , Pakistan is still one of the most numerous minority groups in Pakistan .
according to various estimates , they represent around 1.@@ 6 per cent of the country &apos;s 200@@ -@@ million population .
many of them are compla@@ ining about constant discrimination and are fe@@ ar@@ ful of rob@@ ber@@ ts , rape and forced marriages .
the &apos; persecution started shortly after a separation &apos; , in J@@ og@@ is@@ a , a J@@ og@@ is@@ a , a few months ago , just a few months before two countries to get out of drought in the current Pakistan area .
no time has passed since we have been able to live in peace .
I wanted to come back in order to live in the middle of our prices .
the National Government of India , N@@ ara N@@ ara , has said that it wishes to make it easier for religious reasons in the persecuted for religious reasons .
last year , the government started to make it possible for immigrants to be given their place of residence in their place of residence , in the past , by the central government in the past .
the price of Pakistan to India will be able to be able to obtain urgent citizenship after seven years in a country .
because of bureaucratic delays , this process is often a great deal more time-@@ consuming .
6@@ 4-@@ year-old K@@ han@@ ar@@ am@@ j@@ i in 1997 and became India &apos;s citizenship in 2005 .
many have , however , said that he has abandoned and return to Pakistan , because you see that there is no good life in India .
the government does not offer any support .
we are , like cattle , cattle .
we are simply trying to survive &apos; , in the war , K@@ han@@ ar@@ am@@ j@@ i .
even worse , however , the scepticism of the authorities is even worse .
those who do not have citizenship must be subjected to the harassment of intelligence agencies .
they are being treated for suspects and Pakistan &apos;s agents &apos; , he explained .
the S@@ ing@@ h So@@ d@@ h@@ l of S@@ ing@@ h So@@ d@@ h@@ l , which has been committed to helping Pakistan , had to take place in 2014 , but it has now been dece@@ iv@@ ing .
during the Mo@@ di government , tensions have increased between India and Pakistan , and the most migrants are suffering from it .
&apos;@@ their life becomes a hel@@ l &apos; , the S@@ h@@ l So@@ d@@ h@@ l .
for many , however , the treatment is better than in Pakistan .
Ho@@ ro@@ j@@ i fled the two adults in India two years ago , because it had started to be able to be able to observe the killing of their P@@ ak@@ istan@@ is neighbours .
to save our life , we had to fle@@ e to India , a 6@@ 5-@@ year-old Ho@@ ro@@ j@@ i , whose grand@@ parents were from the current Indian area , but found themselves in the border by the state .
my grand@@ father joined the work after the other .
but he said to us that we are at the right moment to move to India , because the idea that the future can be dangerous for prices .

last week , a total of EUR 1 000 was collected on ch@@ ari@@ table selling .
Mr K@@ ol@@ k K@@ ol@@ k : P@@ u@@ ha@@ ke for the whole year , so that there should be no need to do so .
I was , of course , to blame for the fact that this rest did not rest .
I was also a somewhat needed worker , but I think it is the only one who has been replaced by being replaced .
it is not for themselves to blame for the g@@ rand sense of duty in my own bre@@ ast .
the quo@@ tation I mentioned at the beginning of this House is fine that it is completely true .
this was the case - a new agency , which I took in March of the same year , has called for a lot of work , but nothing so much to me in this work in a so@@ ya , so much better recover from three months to a completely new life , broke out .
there is now a summer , the time of holidays .
it is time to make the new@@ annual promises , to look at what has happened in life and what the whole of this col@@ oured .
after all , it is a Christmas and a year of year , and it is now a good citizen that is now a good citizen .
perhaps , but we all know from our own experience that Christmas is not fit for thinking and for setting targets .
well , I will only speak for myself - I will not be able to make any change in the annual change .
that is too difficult for me .
of course , in the run-up to Christmas , there is a good fortu@@ ne and jo@@ y : I like to be aware of the beginning of the light of the light of the White Christmas and also in J@@ es@@ us , with a great deal of sympathy , revolu@@ tion@@ ist .
nevertheless , I am largely very ti@@ red and sometimes in stress in the Christmas period , which is already in the process of dar@@ k@@ ness .
yes , I am working on a lot of work in terms of holiday free life , perhaps more so than I would like to go to the slaugh@@ ter@@ houses of the image of the image of the image and I have constantly been quite clear .
in most cases , I have run in the run-up to Christmas , such as slavery , at least four Christmas , a little more burden at work ...
when taking into account the un@@ failing social pressure to feel un@@ condi@@ tionally and peace in the heart of the Christmas period , the difficulties in the Christmas period are evident .
but the desperate and ti@@ red person will not be able to make good decisions , even to improve them .
there are more or less such things to be made more or less .
the ti@@ red person is thro@@ wing up a blan@@ k and res@@ ounding promise , which is the foundations of the future in the form of the future , about buying a lo@@ t@@ tery tic@@ kets .
a promise that is intended to change should be thought cal@@ mly , it should be of the benefits , which should be a plan .
the plan , quite apart from the pledge , will also include the target of action and does not go further after the over@@ la@@ ps .
that is why I say that it is the best time for us to push for the ground now , in the summer .
it is simply necessary to break out cal@@ mly and to ha@@ unt why this fa@@ ti@@ gue is so high ( if it ) .
if you do not undertake yourself at the time of the holiday during the holiday period , then it is enough for a few weeks to find a few of our lives in order to find a few con@@ si@@ d@@ ent , which deserves a gu@@ l@@ f , and to think about how exactly this has been done .
I think it is important to live as possible to ensure that there is no need to have a holiday , not a year .
so that leave would be an additional kind of honour , not for survival , a bo@@ x@@ a@@ y in which the par@@ ity is so many so much to be able to accept the next few years .
I would like to advise everyone at least one easy matter - if you have to rise in a time of time next morning , then in good time to s@@ lee@@ p this evening .
I believe that , when one of the ten Po@@ in@@ ers and my recommendation take he@@ ed , life in Estonia would be considerably improved .
I myself am going to follow my advice .
such attempts are being made to make people .
it would be a very good idea to think about and draw conclusions .
the recommendation to investigate the background of the in@@ adver@@ tors to study a little more time is evident .
more generally , however , everyone could have a strategy that is shared by the social media in the social media .
at national level , however , it must be asked whether officials and politicians are sufficiently aware of the dangers of the social media .
the lif@@ es@@ p@@ an has resulted in the summer school , with the summer school , but it is certainly not the case .
the fourth Est@@ onian person was in Finland .
together with the Finnish media in the North Est@@ on@@ on@@ ic hospital ( P@@ ER@@ H ) of doctors in the North Est@@ on@@ on@@ ic hospital ( P@@ ER@@ H ) and the po@@ di@@ ol@@ o@@ gue P@@ en@@ ti , the period after the operation has gone into a expected period .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou are very difficult to say how long the patient had managed to live with the new heart &apos; , talked about the P@@ war .
it has now been a maximum of eight years who have been living in the world for a maximum of eight years now .
the man himself is still not prepared to talk about this issue .
he was diagno@@ sed with a lack of conscience for the first time two years ago , and the disease had already reached the final stage , a failure to concern the cause of paternity .
for this sick person , transplantation was the only option &apos; , including Thailand .
according to Kar@@ di@@ o@@ passion , the patient has no longer been involved in the gu@@ n , with a heart of conscience or a guide .
it is only a s@@ mi@@ le of the development and immunity that they are all about .
the patient can do sport and live in general , as the usual person is &apos; , clause .
the first year is the most dangerous .
the P@@ y@@ der included that full recovery takes three to six months .
according to both doctors , the patient must be strictly monitored in a regular manner ; however , there are also adverse effects on medicinal products .
in addition , the patient must be subject to controls in order to avoid the structural reaction of the donor .
the most dangerous year is the first year , but from IS@@ H@@ L@@ T , the International Soci@@ ety and L@@ un@@ g Trans@@ plus , over 50 per cent of patients are already living in 50 % of patients .
Thailand said that the results are better and for the long@@ est for the most 25 years of sincere care .
Kar@@ di@@ o@@ passion has explained that , because because of the disease , because of the disease , the blood of the patient had a heart of conscience , a heart of conscience to help the operation .
when the emphasis on the man of man &apos;s l@@ ung was down , he became a suitable candidate for transplantation .
the operation operation is not considered to be a very complicated section in the case : it is very important to have the right time to do so .
&apos;@@ a great deal more took time to get into the hands of the pu@@ p and then get into the hands of the new heart to put in place &apos; , clause &apos; .
in addition , the car@@ di@@ o@@ gy operation has brought out a body of po@@ lar@@ ising blood in blood roun@@ ds , as part of the operation .
rather , he may be considered to be a car@@ te , because it is the gu@@ ar@@ di@@ ans who need the least .
there will be much more in the Quartet , the li@@ ver and the l@@ ung East .
it is still an exc@@ iting of this to happen , but we have been getting used for many years .
it is one of the art of the art in this agency to be &apos; , in an anne@@ x to Thailand , to learn the feeling of themselves and their ner@@ vo@@ ous system .
the body still needs four people .
the T@@ AC@@ s have a heart to the patient , because there was no other person who is in a different country in the Community of S@@ can@@ di@@ at@@ transport in a country that is in a state of residence .
the S@@ c@@ an@@ ic transport is the organisation of the organisation , whose members are Denmark , Finland , Iceland , Norway , Sweden and Estonia .
we still have four people in Estonia on the list of profound transplantation .
&apos;@@ Th@@ der patients are still lo@@ cked patients &apos; .
for the most long@@ est , the T@@ AC@@ s said that the great men are expected to be a lot of good men with a positive and positive error .
&apos;@@ in Finland , for around half a year , it has been &apos; .
there is also a lot of conditions for us to get our heart .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou usually do not fit the heart of a woman &apos;s heart , a little bit of a man &apos;s heart , and so on , let us say a car@@ ro@@ o@@ o@@ tive pressure .

the comparison of the Se@@ oul s@@ co@@ res : the Ö@@ ö@@ club &apos;s ticket on the tic@@ kets of tic@@ kets
the consumer committed consumer committed on compar@@ ing the s@@ lee@@ ves of the s@@ tun@@ ts on one night on 11 August on 11 August .
&apos;@@ S@@ ho@@ tel ho@@ tels are a different level and a service choice , so one comparison only on the basis of the price is a very difficult &apos; , talked about the O@@ IS S@@ pa T@@ our@@ s leader , Mr Sa@@ u S@@ pa T@@ our@@ s leader .
there is a need for ca@@ tering accommodation in relation to s@@ lee@@ ping facilities , that the prices of the most favourable packages differ several times and options are available both to a more demanding custom@@ er and a more modest recommendation .
for example , if , for example , if a passenger can be transported for the tune of 51 euro , a one-@@ siz@@ e-@@ f@@ its@@ -@@ air centre in the house of V@@ ä@@ l@@ t S@@ pa in a single seat and the un@@ restra@@ ined use of water efficiency and the un@@ restricted use of water , with the un@@ restricted use of the law and sa@@ un@@ i@@ un@@ i@@ un@@ i@@ un@@ i@@ un@@ i@@ un@@ i@@ un@@ i@@ un@@ i@@ un@@ i@@ tion must be included in a package of EUR 2@@ 87 per person .
it contains accommodation in the tone of D@@ ou@@ b@@ le D@@ el@@ x@@ e , a break@@ fast of a break@@ fast resta@@ ur@@ ant in the to@@ tal@@ ds of break@@ fast , and &apos; a &apos; half-@@ day &apos; package .
when it comes to the various packages , it should be taken into account that a friend or a co-@@ cap should be taken into account , because bil@@ a@@ ter@@ isation will have to be more advantageous than an individual to be taken .
however , if there is a desire for a holiday on its own , it will be offered to the visitors , both in such a special way , for the extra charge , both for the same , for the extra charge .
if , in general , the passenger must be paid by the passenger to pay the extra charges for their presence alone in the tw@@ of@@ old tone , and it will also be possible to find more positive options when it comes to compromises .
for example , the F@@ R@@ A M@@ are T@@ hal@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ h@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ h@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ h@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as S@@ p@@ as
in this case , EUR 58 will be needed .
it is worthwhile to be flexible in order to win the most favoured dilemma .
the prices of package prices are dynamic , which is dependent on a week &apos;s week and an improvement .
in the &apos; most positive package &apos; , prices can vary from EUR 112 to EUR 2@@ 48 since EUR 2@@ 48 , the sale and marketing leader of the Su@@ pp@@ ine R@@ pa@@ a@@ ve leader , Tri@@ in@@ u , in Tri@@ in@@ u , are their price policy .
he also pointed out that in their ho@@ tel , the price is changing , depending on the improvement , and in the anne@@ xes that , in general , the custom@@ er prices can be more favourable to the custom@@ er , accounting directly or asking for their own offer .
since the summer period is the fas@@ test , it is worth planning the holiday in good time to avoid a situation in which the desired place has been sold .
for example , on the basis of a comparison of package , on 11 August , the P@@ commercial , S@@ wa@@ a and S@@ tr@@ and S@@ pa and conference ho@@ tel are only just s@@ references , as well as on La@@ hero@@ in , has been sold on the my@@ th .
there is a long way to go to the possibilities for the opportunity to fuel the possibilities : almost every large Est@@ onian city will find one or indeed several s@@ lee@@ ves .
at the same time , it is worth looking at the purchase of the package and , at the same time , there will be no major effort in the vic@@ in@@ ity , because it puts prices straight away .
for example , on 1@@ 1-@@ 13 August , the White House is taking place in the White Paper .
at that time , there is a great deal of tourists , demand for accommodation in Haiti , and we have a high level of prices at that time .
&apos;@@ T@@ o , therefore , at this time , we are at a time of preferential accommodation , or &apos; yes &apos; , commen@@ ting the President of the President of the s@@ pa@@ tel wave of President I@@ ren@@ e .

what about this in the air ?

why are aircraft in the air ?
it is the case that , if a great deal of radi@@ ation is for@@ ging on a large scale , it leads to the w@@ ings of the w@@ ings and place at a different rate because the difference diff@@ ered because of the distinction between the aircraft , it is currently exceeding the mass of the aircraft and ex@@ ca@@ res as a whole mas@@ se .
in essence , the same process is in the water .
the right wing is creating a great deal of moving forward , and this , in turn , raises the &apos; ti@@ pp@@ y &apos; basis for the water .

the Si@@ h@@ to@@ va@@ r also stresses the fact that N@@ ac@@ ra f@@ 20 F@@ CS needs to be excluded from the sea and a minimum two cre@@ w in order to get off the sea .

Mr Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e stresses that this book has just made his life and made a new direction for future work .

there are important points on Saturday , which show how the body is exactly .
and the competition shows this in any way that we are preparing here .
today , I believe that my preparation has been quality , both this year and in previous years , so that it is possible to run normally .
with something specific , Estonia , according to the time of Estonia , has not been able to take place in accordance with the time of the day after 13@@ .@@ 05 , in the wake of the age of Estonia after the hom@@ og@@ ene@@ r champi@@ on@@ ships .
in the last few weeks , it is often carried out by training .
let me be , and may be very useful , that the last M@@ M@@ M@@ M week was a little bit easier .
on the physical front , the five days are the order of the day : yesterday &apos;s f@@ las@@ h and clean , today , the war@@ mest trend is being made .
however , it does not want to be very blam@@ ed , however : &apos; I have had his rou@@ gh of our rou@@ gh@@ sho@@ es &apos; .
there is a great deal of silence and peace , and there is no ro@@ g@@ cha@@ ic to be kept to our e@@ ars .
I do not need to look at any motivation that are motivated by vi@@ de@@ o-@@ specific vi@@ de@@ os or reading , but to be present here and at this time , and at this stage , it is the possibility that the a@@ th@@ le@@ a@@ th@@ a@@ th@@ a@@ th@@ a@@ th@@ a@@ th@@ a@@ th@@ a@@ th@@ a@@ th@@ a@@ th@@ a@@ th@@ a@@ th@@ a@@ th@@ a@@ th@@ a@@ th@@ a@@ th@@ a@@ th@@ a@@ th@@ a@@ th@@ a@@
this in itself is a source of specific@@ ity .
it is , of course , a year of excellence , of course , for every year of ligh@@ t@@ ory , and M@@ oun@@ g is a previous starting point , but also competi@@ tions in T@@ purposes , have taken a series of technical nu@@ ances , compared with some bran@@ ches .
there is no more than an opportunity for experim@@ en@@ tation .
&apos;@@ Wel@@ l , it is simply a matter of urgency to drin@@ k &apos; , Mr M@@ ä@@ g , but adds that , if the previous drin@@ k and potentially a few energy will be successful or a few energy supplies , then they will certainly benefit from the next .
for the first time , the ECB is going to be the foun@@ der and ideological cornerstone of the elections .
so far , we said the ECB and we thought the Sa@@ rou@@ gh@@ ar@@ t or vice vers@@ a .
now it must be found without doing so .
in doing so , they also need to be dra@@ gged on the col@@ our@@ ings of the party &apos;s col@@ our@@ ings , at times , of criminal and embarras@@ sing past , the Sa@@ du@@ are , between spon@@ sors and the voters .
the departure of Sa@@ du@@ r makes the most complex situation in the country in an ideological manner .
on the basis of political practice and ideology , it can be said that it will be able to play over the old n@@ in@@ as@@ y .
a number of ma@@ ps , which previously have an effect in the past , may not materi@@ alise this time .
the P@@ op@@ ul@@ ale for the Environment does not work because the Sa@@ du@@ ar can always be allowed to be more than the Prime Minister .
playing a Russian card has been aggra@@ vated in the government as a result of the mandate of the Environment , both in the government and because here we see how the &apos; Sa@@ telli@@ gent &apos; electoral union is sin@@ king gas at the North .
the be@@ are@@ r card is already in the Sa@@ throw of the European Union because of the current trial .
there has also been an insul@@ ting card for the people of the R@@ ah@@ v@@ ine and the poor , for the Middle East .
it is the first of them to have a government in the coalition partners in the government .
one card could , however , be even more important .
all the last recent elections have confirmed that these political parties will be successful , which are able to formulate the fundamental f@@ laws of elections and then implement it .
the main Tibetan has been re@@ m@@ un@@ erated around the Sa@@ du@@ t@@ is .
if some political parties have to brea@@ the life into a good way of life , one of the tru@@ mp points missing in the Middle ic ma@@ gic pac@@ k is missing .
what will remain , then ?
there is a strong party machine and a considerable resource .
in the run-up to the elections , there is also enough .
the cra@@ dle of self-@@ advertise@@ ments from the taxpayer in four years has , I hope , been paid back to the tal@@ ling of the tal@@ ling of the taxpayer .
there is a question of the city of T@@ all@@ in@@ na , but the cultivation of party gu@@ ards in the media have been left there .
in addition , the party has the voice of votes .
their role will remain in place this time from the fire , because the image of the power party is not enough to moti@@ vate voters to moti@@ vate the voters .
in an ideological spirit , the J@@ ü@@ r@@ i Ra@@ ta@@ c will have to find her road because the road to the car@@ ic@@ a@@ ture ended in this week .

the most stu@@ p@@ id questions that are to be put to ba@@ il .
the Hu@@ g@@ man Po@@ st of the ba@@ r has reached the questions that they would not want to hear .
what drin@@ k can you do best ?
in some drin@@ k , there are indeed more ingredients than in the other , but they require the same skil@@ l and w@@ oo@@ se to produce them .
it is often interpreted as a question of &apos; M@@ ta now to be the e@@ asi@@ est / speed now &apos; ? &apos; , which gives them a signal that it is a man of whatever they drin@@ k , preparing it to do so , or not .
what would you do with you most like to close the drin@@ k ?
this issue is interpreted in the same way as to which the co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il would be the e@@ asi@@ est to the ba@@ r .
this is not the case to say , but the custom@@ er is making decisions themselves by their own pur@@ po@@ cket .
rather , the ba@@ r question would be asked if there are some special offers at the moment .
what is good here ?
perhaps there is a b@@ older desire to know whether a ba@@ r diff@@ ers from any offers of any offers , but it could also be asked differently .
nor can the ba@@ r envisaged what the custom@@ er could prefer to favour at all .
is I going to drin@@ k , which would not be very swe@@ ets ?
here , like the previous rule , it is true that the ba@@ si@@ cs are not aware of the tas@@ te and the preferences , and which , for one , may not be for others .
it is , however , prepared to listen to what the tas@@ te of the tas@@ te could contain .
is this drin@@ k to me a hea@@ da@@ che / bo@@ y ?
there is no media in front of the media , and it is not predicted to be able to allow it to be allowed to allow it to be allowed to give the custom@@ er .

the news agency in the A@@ F@@ P has been trying to obtain information from the prosecu@@ tors involved in the last few days , but I did not talk about anything , because an investi@@ ga@@ tive court prohib@@ its information .

women often feel that it is not able to enjoy the &apos; normal &apos; link at the end of the &apos; sex cycle &apos; , when it is known that the positive result will not come .
this leads to tensions , which , in turn , leads to a reduction and fewer bl@@ ind@@ ness means , of course , an even greater opportunity not to pregnant .
however , men feel that they must be able to &apos; speak &apos; , when they are called for .

nobody knows the second better , how best is you best suited to you .

studies have shown that a higher degree of success is couples who sex every few days , but not every few are able to keep such close .
the most important thing is to find a pat@@ tern that fits in the best way of a couple of you .
the 10 un@@ s@@ pea@@ kable advertising , which is more attractive to food , are being made more attractive to the 10 under@@ ground .
because many of the foods are difficult to dis@@ tra@@ ct , the picture will be used instead of another ingredients that people de@@ sc@@ end - for example , instead of milk instead of milk rather than a po@@ ta@@ to@@ l .
the Chancellor of Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be a to@@ ol@@ box will see which tri@@ ps are quite widespread in the advertising world .
if anyone is opening a bo@@ y bu@@ ck or taking a po@@ t out of a box of po@@ cket , a number of some religions were thrown out of it .
in practice , you are longer , and the food for this whole time will not be un@@ a@@ ided because the au@@ r comes from a high level of water , which is not , for example , for sa@@ ic products .
this is why there has been a le@@ ak@@ ed cotton on cotton that has been put in place or food , with the ability to keep its water and hold water to water .
they will be much longer than a Bur@@ ger or bo@@ y , and a product came from a newly newly manufactured look .
the Kar@@ en@@ der is a great deal of aid for photo@@ graph@@ ic , because it does not go about the light of the light or insu@@ lation , or make a significant contribution to a context like many other foods .
for example , it can be a po@@ ta@@ to@@ y instead of the cre@@ cre@@ t or an ice gu@@ n .
there are some col@@ oured and res@@ istan@@ t elements , and the consumer has once again been dece@@ ived .
the flag is replaced by milk .
it is also not easy to dis@@ tra@@ ct milk because they may not be able to see it at all the same way .
the food products supplied with milk are also becoming fast-@@ s@@ ory within it .
since , for example , the morning &apos;s ma@@ ker or m@@ y@@ s@@ que have to look at the c@@ lu@@ m@@ sy and m@@ oo@@ k , milk instead of milk is used instead of milk , which will not be conducted by any b@@ reat@@ h .
if resta@@ ur@@ ants can be worked hard to see meat , so that the result would be a volume and par@@ cel , then it will not be done in advertise@@ ments .
however , it is particularly attractive to have the meat presented in advertise@@ ments , which is particularly attractive .
however , it is often a target of a contribution or a lack of money , and it is attra@@ cted to meat g@@ ri@@ l@@ ling , as a s@@ kin@@ ning tri@@ bun@@ al .
it is just as difficult to work with a ca@@ ke , because it ten@@ ds .
fortunately , there is a product that is virtually identical to the w@@ rec@@ k of w@@ rec@@ k - the be@@ ac@@ k arrest .
it may , therefore , be a advertise@@ ment in advertise@@ ments or within the milk co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il .
even in the shop on the surface of fruit , there may be a fa@@ ke la@@ yer that makes their a@@ po@@ cal@@ ing .
however , it is not enough for the fo@@ cal point and the s@@ pra@@ ying of cotton to the fruit s@@ pra@@ ying instead of de@@ o@@ dor@@ ant .
it is also not the fo@@ ol@@ o@@ genic , because the length of time will turn into liqu@@ id or , for example , water .
here , however , it is necessary to help the ba@@ r , with a particular col@@ our@@ ings and a more permanent way to make a cheap is@@ san@@ ct .
they have probably also been used on those images where cho@@ col@@ ate cho@@ col@@ ate cho@@ col@@ ate cho@@ col@@ ate in a school or a residu@@ al way .
if a code of advertise@@ ments in advertise@@ ments , which was ideal , was ideal , there are probably some additional la@@ yers of being used or pieces of paper .
this is because it can be dis@@ solved in the paragraphs and to break the picture .
if , after the delay , the introduction of bat@@ teri@@ es and s@@ pra@@ ying them into a further level leaves a much beautiful impression .
it is also being used within the bur@@ ger , and that all the ingredients there are in order to put it in order to make them a good place .
that is why , as in advertise@@ ments , the Bur@@ ger on the table does not seem to be on the table .
the paper has been cop@@ i@@ ed .
in advertise@@ ments , the ba@@ g is ex@@ pelled from the ba@@ g and compli@@ city , but it may not even be prepared to be matu@@ red .
the impression that we are sending out is the impression full of a paper , if necessary , with a po@@ ta@@ to@@ ire , if necessary , and then simply s@@ pra@@ ys simply on the bro@@ wn of bro@@ wn .
it is particularly in America &apos;s advertise@@ ments , especially in America &apos;s advertise@@ ments , because this image creates a great deal of pan@@ ic in people .
in actual fact , we absor@@ b a ca@@ talo@@ gue of c@@ ab@@ y@@ gen quickly , and a flo@@ til@@ la dis@@ appears from the eyes of the photo@@ graph@@ ic .
this is why every single currency is being s@@ pra@@ yed with a pu@@ ri@@ fication tool , which will help avoid rapid im@@ parti@@ ality .
it is often not aid and , therefore , it is to be taken to aid the gol@@ den oil oil , which is being presented on the ban@@ ner of ther@@ mal co@@ ca@@ ters and is being presented as a transplantation .
Estonia was in favour of the UK &apos;s better and the A@@ -@@ di@@ v@@ al will not be admitted to the A@@ -@@ di@@ v@@ al .
the match started at an extremely pace , and the first quarter of the first , with five points ( 18 : 23 ) , were du@@ mped a lot of cor@@ n .
the second quarter of the difference was even further and a separation of rest in the n@@ ine@@ -based success rate ( 31 : 40 ) .
Estonia was able to win the third quarter , but only one point .
the situation of the gu@@ ar@@ di@@ ans before the last 10 minutes were tw@@ of@@ old ( 46 : 54 ) .
the fourth quarter of a quarter of Estonia was fully and , in the end , it had to be adopted with a total of 61 : 75 .
the loss of the gu@@ ar@@ di@@ ans c@@ rus@@ hed the hopes of A@@ -@@ di@@ v@@ al , because there are only two best redundancies .

the media used the opportunity to ask me that what I have been doing for Estonia &apos;s success and which I can be proud .
I am pleased that we are a good team in the government , and many important decisions have been made , many of which have been expected for more than 10 years in Estonia , which have been struck by the social media today .
according to the level of the state , these decisions are , for example , a reform of the tax on people &apos;s income , the pension reform for the elderly , for the elderly , to balance the development of Estonia , to balance the development of agricultural aid , the increase in agricultural subsidies , and , of course , health reform accessible and high quality care .

it is worth known : how many are the sugar sugar in the milk sector ?
according to the European Union &apos;s food labelling standards , the package can be issued on the pac@@ k quantity and sugar quantity of car@@ b@@ ons , which does not equ@@ ate at all of the White Paper &apos; , confirmed by the marketing director of V@@ ali@@ o Est@@ in in K@@ ris@@ ta Kal@@ b@@ in .
he said that , in practice , there are three types of sugar in milk products : the lit@@ mus test of milk in milk , the g@@ ard@@ ro@@ g , the g@@ ru@@ p and f@@ ru@@ p , and an accompanying ratio , or a suc@@ rose in a suc@@ rose .
however , if we remember a few simple core ba@@ si@@ cs , the calculation of sugar in sugar , which has been included in the Kal@@ b@@ in , should not be prepared .
first of all , it must be clarified whether it is milk or w@@ ounded milk products .
in normal milk and milk products , around 5 grams of a modi@@ cu@@ m of milk , a modi@@ cu@@ m of a &apos; 100 grams per &apos; per product , are included in ordinary milk and milk .
in the case of H@@ over@@ ning milk products , there has been a drop in a part of the ha@@ p@@ id or ca@@ pac@@ bac@@ teri@@ bac@@ teri@@ bac@@ teri@@ bac@@ teri@@ a , which has resulted in the average of 3.@@ 5@@ g / 10@@ 0@@ g on average in the ha@@ p@@ pi@@ ed milk products .
in order to calcu@@ late the amount of sugar added to the amount of sugar , the first to calcu@@ late the amount of sugar in sugar , the Kal@@ b@@ in .
now , you need to calcu@@ late the f@@ has@@ tic and g@@ r@@ ü@@ r@@ k coming from the collection of sugar in sugar .
&apos;@@ A@@ p@@ pro@@ p@@ y is , in the case of the usual and 4 % of the annual milk products usual in the event of an ordinary 3-@@ 4 % of fruit content , a 0.@@ 3 grams per cent in the event of the 0.@@ 3 grams and , in particular , several 15 % of the few per cent per cent per cent per 100 grams per 100 grams per 100 grams per 100 grams per 100 grams per 100 grams per 100 grams per 100 grams per 100 grams per 100 grams per 100 grams
he said that this simple calculation shows that the percentage of sugar included in the mar@@ ty@@ rs may be up to two times less than the amount of sugar mentioned in the package .
in the case of free products , the situation is slightly different , because it is dependent on production technology for them .

why are the do@@ gs ?
sometimes , it is thought that the do@@ g is eating up if he does not feel well and want to be able to do so .
in actual fact , most of them are completely healthy do@@ gs .
only less than 10 per cent of the do@@ gs , who break the face of some of the disease , are just less than 10 per cent .
one of the reasons why the do@@ g can suddenly start to eat can be nutri@@ tious food products .
those do@@ gs , who have religions , could be able to feel more interested in the face of the face .
so , when a do@@ g who has not been broken in the past is suddenly , and he is eating it often , it is worth going to control the doctor so that , for example , the problems of the possible s@@ wine problems can be quickly left .
it is worth mentioning that the do@@ g can also be broken because he likes its tas@@ te or he is simply fore@@ ver .
when a health problem has been ruled out , it would be worth making sure that the family &apos;s fav@@ ou@@ rite is still receiving enough and m@@ ali@@ cious action .

the representative of the Me@@ te@@ o@@ gy Office in the war that Norway , which stands for a certain type of fears in Korean language , will then be called to the North and em@@ it over the ra@@ tionality of Ky@@ us@@ h@@ u , even though the main sections of the island were hit by the in@@ sin@@ u@@ ous and floods in the last month , which were killed by 36 people and left four missing , would probably be the most m@@ ali@@ cious .
&apos;@@ This is a very slow storm &apos; , including him , noting that there is therefore a greater flood threat , because in one area there is a great deal of rain in a long period of time .
Norway , which was at one point in a moment of five years , is a long@@ es@@ sion@@ al storm , to start making up two weeks ago and , in front of the Pacific , the northern part of the Pacific , before moving towards hope , by Japan and weakening its approach to the convergence routes .
the representative said that , depending on the change of the Kur@@ ds , Norway may be able to move straight over to a Ky@@ us@@ h@@ u and then the Japanese H@@ on@@ sh@@ u Islands , but it is still difficult to find a long-term path .

in the Cas@@ ta@@ y six that the F@@ ar@@ is@@ h had been abused in a long period of time .
his lawyer said that the man went home to F@@ ar@@ ish@@ i and &apos; in the hope of him in the hope of listening to the eye &apos; and not to kill him .
L@@ ord S@@ um@@ m@@ ers claimed that the Cas@@ ta@@ y showed signs of an attack on the attack on the day , and the social work report showed the social work report , which showed that the gu@@ ilt had been in force for training of specialist forces in the army on how to am@@ ic@@ ish the group .
there was no charges for F@@ ar@@ ish@@ ing .

important issues were addressed in the debate , such as the development of ship@@ w@@ rec@@ ts and airlines between the small island and continents .
the country has committed itself to ensuring a regular regular transport links with the small communities , but , for example , the increasing traffic in the summer period also makes the important driving of local inhabitants more difficult .
these are places where the country can already be able to take account of local wishes and needs to take account of local wishes and needs to be taken into account in the event of an early and planning process .
in addition , we were discussing the issue of construction of the construction , interest of the island , the safety and rescue capacity of the island .

since a man or a woman who could be in a few Tom@@ every mar@@ ried is not aware , then the war is a complete my@@ ster@@ y .

&apos;@@ now I am or able to understand what the path was meant to be a &apos; , a woman &apos; .

&apos;@@ because the F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k is found and is looking for different things , I thought the first to try to try there &apos; , Mr Kar@@ in , whose post@@ ing has been shared by nearly 4 000 people .

it was , however , the feeling that it was needed now .
that my man has become the largest fraud and have been heard .
frankly , I am concerned at the beginning , but later , when the comments came to the comments that I myself have had with the war on the ground , it is already a laugh@@ ing .
it was also the idea of the idea that perhaps the war has reached a return from the other round of clothing .
&apos;@@ no@@ h , most recently six months ago , a second round was purchased to work , which went without a thorough investigation into the machine , but does it really mean that a woman is being debated .
be fine , but with the life of life , we have agreed that we now need to find the war on the ground .
that is the reason for the disappearance of this war .
divorce , family stem or whatever .
I think that this is the only thing that is the only thing , because if , if I may ever be lost , I know that I would be very grateful to a person who would try to find me and to return property .

the Ger@@ man@@ t S@@ hu@@ l and the Group of the F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k S@@ hu@@ l in T@@ all@@ in@@ n was &apos; noticed in T@@ all@@ in@@ n &apos; , shared information in North T@@ all@@ ine and the pre@@ pare@@ dness of the North .
in two weeks &apos; time , the police are in touch and announced that the S@@ sensitive crime has been identified .
&apos;@@ I had a question of the da@@ u@@ gh@@ e and the night of Monday , you went to the lou@@ dness of the da@@ u@@ gh@@ e , because the old age of her hand had been injured and the war on the war , where it had been defe@@ ated .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou lost it in the morning of this day when he wal@@ ked his house , he said .
from time to time , we still need to go to the forest , whatever reason .
however , when the gap between the sk@@ in , then is the time to make one image of the road .
there are enough tools for doing so .
it is a small overview of the protection home !
we are talking about the s@@ mi@@ le because it will be obli@@ ging and quite a route that is to a certain extent , which is to a certain degree virtual operation , but is not the best for our health .
it is always prepared to be able to try to be tested , because both prescri@@ ptions and the tas@@ te are different .
for some we are not needed for a long time , it is only enough to take hot water , others , on the other hand , must be left behind .
naturally , it must also be careful that water and plants should be clean .
it is also dependent on a ye@@ arly period of time and time .
let us take a closer look at how to prepare some simple road drin@@ k and what impact they can have on us .
M@@ o@@ k@@ u@@ ro@@ k Ro@@ ad .
the M@@ o@@ k@@ on ni@@ cks may be a week of a calm year .
if it is a day to God &apos;s 2 lit@@ res of water , this is a good way to meet the need and also to be able to provide a little extra energy .
as in the case of all plants , it is also possible to obtain useful elements using alternative methods , for example , by c@@ rus@@ hing - o@@ ils are not enough for a long time , it is enough to be heard of hot water and for a few hours .
there will be 0.@@ 4 lit@@ res of water , which are to be w@@ aged for 15 minutes .
the result is a drin@@ k in which there are nearly 25 m@@ g C@@ -@@ vita@@ l , a great deal of ca@@ ke and a c@@ in@@ k .
in addition , the drin@@ k contains about 1.5 sugar k@@ g of sugar , which is the 20 k@@ l sugar .
in order to make a tas@@ te in order to make a tas@@ te , we always have to add a s@@ mi@@ le and honey .
and , when the drin@@ k took it to the Chamber , it can be wa@@ tered down to the water , such as transplantation .
the preparation of the ca@@ ke works in the same way , but the drin@@ k is somewhat different in a different way .
the V@@ ar wait is excellent and will help against a great many problems , a tri@@ cky tri@@ cky tri@@ bun@@ al .
the V@@ ar will help to overcome the fa@@ ti@@ gue , the operation and will help in the event of crop diseases , as well as as a result of the reduction in fe@@ aring .
as a result , it would not be worth over a day .
the V@@ ar wait is also to leave , so winter should be found for a more peaceful moment .
you will take fresh va@@ c@@ ar@@ ts in the winter , while taking advantage of the co@@ w , the equ@@ ation , equ@@ als or mar@@ ried .
there is a small face of the length of the Par@@ k Time , which is to be war@@ ped until water takes the red tone .
the V@@ ar to@@ ol@@ box can also be drawn .
in order to do so , the st@@ ops and ho@@ sts of this eru@@ ptions will be transported in a few hours .
a longer and more thorough unemployment is also a scandal .
the va@@ can@@ cies of the ground can also be included in the game of the game .
Mus@@ t@@ s@@ k@@ s@@ s@@ k@@ u@@ k .
Mrs Muscardini is a c@@ oo@@ k , which looks like a pat@@ ch@@ s@@ k in the gu@@ ise as a black piece of bo@@ gu@@ s .
in most cases , there are benefits , but also elsewhere .
the area of Se@@ e is a very broad one - a hot po@@ ver@@ r - to blame , instead of the virus , and so on .
the ash will also be very well was@@ hed .
a kind of super@@ market is a kind of super@@ drin@@ k , which can be used to be used to be used for a great many diseases , even cancer , or len@@ i@@ ency , to increase stress , to minimise stress life expectancy .
I have a number of uni@@ qu@@ en@@ ess uni@@ qu@@ en@@ ess and a lot of B@@ -@@ vita@@ min@@ ine , as well as anti-@@ min@@ er@@ ts and a little min@@ eral and lou@@ der .
the road from Se@@ en@@ est may be a day , a risk of over@@ consumption is not at risk .
in order to go to you , around 3 x@@ ies are enough to do so , which is to be transported in 2 to 3 lit@@ res for five and 15 minutes .
a woman is wal@@ king around the earth : my agenda is USD 5 !
having said that , I have also had such experience , it is true 40 days , where I have decided to have a &apos; whole@@ hear@@ ted life &apos; in southern France to simply be free and live on the day .
it was in the night of night , in the wild , towns , towns and so on .
in my second week , I joined one French &apos; , 44 old man &apos; .
O@@ i , do not think that there is a s@@ mi@@ le s@@ tun@@ s : we are simply talking about the M@@ en@@ ton and we got our friends , even though she was 15@@ a older , was a good thing .
it turned out that the man is a good family , Par@@ i@@ is@@ a , a former officer of the French na@@ val officer .
the Al@@ ko@@ t will not be wise , no more so , a good person , a good person , a good person and a good person , life has seen life .
the joint link with him and the next 3 weeks , together with the city of the city , and also about 5 per day .
the money was still needed , so much to live .
the man taught how night help was provided to provide ho@@ tels and resta@@ ur@@ ant farms on the fa@@ ke of ho@@ tels and resta@@ ur@@ ant farms .
we did work so much so that it would be for the two days of the feed and then to go further ...
at some point , I have been in no way at any point and decided that no more ...
I took the flight to Hel@@ sin@@ ki , there .
and , by the way , I regret .
those 40 days were probably the best of my life .
Mrs F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k recently referred to F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k : &apos; the quote is a poor recital .
that is why I am not going to look back and try not to recall what has been done in history to re@@ increase human creation and what results have been achieved .
I do not give the assessment of whether these attempts can be considered a success or a failure .
I am also avoiding excessive sources , even though I support my most important teachers in the idea of Mr T@@ in Pa@@ u@@ l : all of my thoughts have been borro@@ wing , if only remember .
the most con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ous development of the Est@@ onian Republic of Estonia is a re@@ production of the citizens of the Est@@ onian Republic - a perfect person .
we do not grow him , as we grow in a child , in good faith that someone can .
we are growing him for such as the ruling class , which one person should be to have to live in Estonia and speak openly .
censorship is perfect .
although the local ruling class became part of a year ago , some cultivation methods are equally frigh@@ tening , when the last ruling class , now impover@@ ished , are not at least below the previous ones .
they are simply different .
Latvia &apos;s shoul@@ ders are a mar@@ ker in a new era .
national leaders &apos; 0.@@ 5 proto@@ cols &apos;
the ruling class is not only those politicians who receive the country &apos;s salary from their work , but also those who are doing politics on a voluntary basis ( read : deliberately ) : write on the part of the mu@@ d@@ in mu@@ t , a boycot@@ t , a boycot@@ t , a boycot@@ t , a boycot@@ t , a boycot@@ t , a boycot@@ t , a boycot@@ t .
they are willing to be only EC@@ H@@ O Ch@@ am@@ ber ( in the case of people who live in a space where there are only the appropriate opinions , such as their own F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k friends and so on ) , but in Estonia , it is not possible .
there are still some of those who think or do something that is un@@ be@@ arable intolerable .
and it is the spirit that we are getting rid of and d@@ wel@@ l@@ l@@ ings on the my@@ ster@@ y .
we have a great deal of politicians who know exactly how much person can be s@@ lee@@ p , with whom a lot of children can be si@@ ck@@ en , how to do work , how to do so , to see how to do so , how to be able to think about the way in which to think about how to go about when the disease is to be dying .
very important positions .
if their public speaking is anything but what they themselves said , they are bo@@ gged down , insul@@ ted , hy@@ ste@@ ria .
the fact that people in several European countries are entitled &apos; full &apos; , and it is allowed by law , and they do not undermine their opinion .
zero tolerance is the only permitted cra@@ dle in every area , but with zero tolerance , there is not a ca@@ us@@ ess , but pa@@ int evil .
there is a sense of class an@@ ger and fa@@ ts - only a good sense .
they are able to open only a gender , but never a heart .
they believe that every &apos; measure &apos; , which they will improve in society , operate and is trying to make a test .
they are fortunately that we have sufficient attention to the glass of glass of the glass of C@@ ari@@ ad , the qualifications of mental disabilities , who go through every window , without the pain of the pain .
that is why it seems to us if a few cle@@ ver farmers are opening up their mel@@ t@@ down , and he would be be@@ a@@ ten in the sense that it is a sensible way of doing so that it is reasonable .
a few words that certainly send us , are tomorrow , a refugee , a refugee , a woman , violence , and a j@@ ig@@ saw .
if you believe everything that holders of self-@@ interest officials , activists and politicians ( such is a small part of all groups , but they will be able to pre@@ tend that the whole society is compla@@ ining ) and writing , a citizen is not only a dis@@ gus@@ ting , for@@ mi@@ dable and un@@ pleasant , but also for temporary free , without temporary .
but let us not believe , let us not tolerate a ban , do not prohibit drin@@ k .
the people of Estonia drin@@ k as much as he wants , not as much as it promises .
the people of Estonia tole@@ rant more in any case if they do not be forced to tolerate .
the people of Estonia will not change their behaviour for two months before the elections so that , following the elections , following its popul@@ arity of the popular order , and again not only , but also to make it out of what un@@ sa@@ cro@@ san@@ ct temporary fa@@ ts will be restored quickly .
who differently is not the right way to go .
I do not believe that any person can be re@@ built .
I believe that people can be taught .
drin@@ k in a sensible way , love my family , to be a question of work , a poli@@ cy-@@ making , not only friends , but for the whole of society .
it is not for us to have fines , limit , ban , ban , to order , to call a cor@@ ner , the media disgrace with the memor@@ ies of the memor@@ ies .
the teachers must set an example .
a politician talks about the damage of tobacco ?
at a time of radi@@ ation , the poli@@ ce@@ man is going to make a penalty for exceeding speed ?
and , then , it will be one of the other words between my colleague ...
I have such a ri@@ ce idea that perhaps we should try to re@@ increase the current class .
I say to them that do not drin@@ k in a secret .
if you drin@@ k , drin@@ k publicly : in the history of the whole of the people .
the speed of h@@ aste only publicly - the cars of ru@@ lers , also private cars , are all red .
if you govern , then , as you govern ourselves .
perhaps , then , it is a disgrace if words and actions do not go together .
or we can know that we ourselves want us to govern them .
because we all , the example of the example , are what we do not want to be at all .
where are fleeing from ourselves ?
for this weekend , the in@@ sin@@ u@@ ation is allowed , so it would be time to take a good trend in advance .
why not tri@@ m@@ m@@ ali@@ cious m@@ ali@@ cious !
Mrs R@@ E g@@ or@@ ies share recommendations for nine exercise , which should help to achieve a s@@ lower and better tone .
ar@@ gu@@ ably , the first change should be seen after the first trend after the first trend .
the bus and coach leader saved eight images from the road route , without knowledge that do@@ gs actually have the ow@@ ner .
&apos;@@ W@@ hen I put those eight of these eight , I would have thrown out the &apos; no &apos; in a cor@@ ner , a woman in a cor@@ ner , a bus leader , who has es@@ ca@@ ped the br@@ unt of the ta@@ ck , to be transferred to the worker of asylum .
soon , however , the ow@@ ner of a do@@ g of do@@ gs , for whom it was not in@@ sensitive , is the ma@@ ker of their homes to take place .
Mr Har@@ ya has said that he has been working as a coach driver from the beginning of the 1990s , but such a case has not come before the beginning of the 1990s , but this case has not come to the normal number of 14@@ 6 in his usual route to bus and coach .
in the case of Har@@ ju@@ -@@ Asse@@ t , I noted that there is a little bit along the way around the road .
I thought that this is a hand , but it turned out that four months &apos; , reminded the coach driver .
it has gone to heart , and he stopped passengers , and he stopped passengers , in order to re@@ lin@@ qu@@ ish them .
&apos;@@ L@@ o@@ w started , cars would have over@@ run and do@@ gs away from them &apos; , in the war .
he added that the passengers were reasonable and they also provided a great deal of jo@@ y to them .
K@@ u@@ ci@@ ans at the beginning of K@@ u@@ en@@ e at the beginning of K@@ u@@ en@@ e were slightly afraid , but then it became fu@@ n .
K@@ u@@ ri@@ ca@@ -@@ u@@ ps , went to a new front in the coach driver , because the driving schedule needed to be complied with .
once again , when he came to the in@@ ner inven@@ tory , he saw four small do@@ gs at the same time .
it was a German sheep of sheep .
they were so immediately and immediately see that they have been taken care of .
do@@ gs were beautiful , even courageous .
the first idea was , of course , that someone wanted to get rid of them &apos; , the bus leader , that , for this reason , he decided that he had a cu@@ t-@@ off .
I have also taken them four months and called the police &apos; , reminded O@@ O@@ le@@ g .
it was in T@@ all@@ in@@ na animal asylum , which was the worker that came into the Baltic Sea , which came to the communities in the Baltic Sea .
but is bus and coach driver not temp@@ ted to take it ?
there was such a point .
one in the private po@@ cket was both beautiful and calm .
it was beautiful as adults &apos; , said &apos; O@@ le@@ g &apos; .
but where do I put these eight months ?
I have thrown up a woman with the do@@ gs .
we also have a small child .
once again , it is the order of a do@@ g &apos; , he added .
the T@@ all@@ in@@ na A@@ bi@@ as , E@@ ve To@@ bi@@ as confirmed that there was indeed 8 German images of sheep , who are two and a half months old .
but , on the same day , the ow@@ ner came to the evil .
&apos;@@ We have not even finalised those parts and we gave them no less &apos; , he said .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou have not been very ang@@ ry , but he said that they have the only house of the house of the house and the bus and coach leader could have asked whether they are &apos; yes &apos; to them &apos; , Mr To@@ as .
the author of asylum , however , is that , at the same time , it is a good thing that , at the same time , it is a good thing that the path taken by bus and coach to the path taken by bus and coach and therefore did not happen .
in actual fact , it was very good that he reacted .
the land@@ s@@ ca@@ pes have met where if necessary , if necessary , if necessary , if necessary , if necessary , if necessary , if necessary , it will simply not be possible .
there is a solution to A@@ TV there .
the A@@ TV , which is used in the military sphere , has looked at the home of Q@@ a .
there is nothing new with the use of such a ligh@@ t@@ weight and well-@@ though@@ tful and well-@@ though@@ tful vehicles in the use of the use of vehicles in military structures .
the need for them has already been highlighted during the Second World War , more attention was given to them in the decade later .
simpli@@ city and strength
in 195@@ 6 , in 195@@ 6 , the M@@ -@@ 27@@ 4 were known to be known - the further development of the Second World War in the endless year of the Second World War , w@@ ounded for w@@ ounded , w@@ ounded .
it is a little bit like a little bit like a fa@@ ir@@ y@@ man of mechan@@ ical mu@@ k .
it is difficult to imagine the vehicle that is hard to imagine .
a wh@@ eel@@ chair platform , from a wh@@ eel@@ s and ro@@ a : everything , the whole of the whole .
if there were excessive engine@@ ered engine@@ ers on the do@@ or@@ step too from too truth and a cut in production , they have started down .
however , in the war , however , it counts a great deal more per@@ sever@@ ance .
in this category , it was not the test to be tested in Vietnam &apos;s j@@ ung@@ le .
it was easy to get easy , less than five hundred kil@@ og@@ ram@@ s in the ne@@ ver@@ -@@ gra@@ m were in places where the brak@@ es of W@@ ill@@ y@@ se Y@@ e@@ e@@ p Y@@ e@@ p Y@@ ill@@ y@@ se Y@@ e@@ p had to show the brak@@ es .
it was predomin@@ antly used to have vehicles of almost 50 to kil@@ o@@ se vehicles on transport routes , both for po@@ pp@@ y and mercury .
once again , the mu@@ mb@@ ers were instal@@ led with a s@@ mi@@ le , to back@@ fire on tan@@ kers .
this lor@@ ry has come under fire , and it still happened , it was perhaps possible to ni@@ p the ro@@ tten system before the ro@@ ck and to allow it to be so low that the vehicle could be managed in the bul@@ l .
as long as 19@@ 70 , it was agreed to 19@@ 70 , these 11 2@@ 40 and were in the army up to 19@@ 80 until 19@@ 80 , which has been ex@@ changed against H@@ M@@ M@@ W@@ W@@ White .
over the two decades , A@@ T@@ V@@ V@@ s have a marg@@ inal significance in the military cir@@ cles .
back to the image of the day , when New York fell into hel@@ l , and the US soldiers found themselves in the deser@@ t of Iraq and Afghanistan &apos;s deser@@ k in the deser@@ t .
it was there that the knowledge and understanding is needed , that there is something to be met between the tri@@ cky H@@ um@@ we@@ e and the foot@@ wear .
since A@@ T@@ V@@ s are generally not offering considerable protection , they are not the best option in order to meet the battle challenges .
however , it is necessary for urgent and easy mach@@ ines to be carried out in order to meet specific tasks .
for example , in a po@@ cket and rescue operations , for example .
currently , there are thousands of A@@ T@@ V@@ s and U@@ T@@ V@@ s in the American army .
most of them , such as the Defence of the Defence Union , were in the same kind of civil servants , but improved in accordance with the needs of the army .
what has been mentioned by the de@@ signs , which has received such names as K@@ aw@@ as@@ ak , H@@ on@@ d@@ ra and F@@ o@@ re@@ man , Y@@ am@@ ah@@ l R@@ adi@@ o and Ar@@ c@@ ti@@ c C@@ at and an increasingly broad@@ ening option of the Pol@@ ar@@ en@@ -@@ A@@ T@@ V@@ s of the military A@@ T@@ V@@ s of A@@ T@@ V@@ s .
in 2013 , in the Pol@@ ari@@ an agreement , the L@@ ate For@@ ce of the American special year ( S@@ O@@ CO@@ M ) ( S@@ O@@ CO@@ M ) and a separate five-year agreement on the S@@ mar@@ ts@@ man based on the S@@ mar@@ ts@@ man based on the S@@ mar@@ ts@@ man based on the S@@ mar@@ ts@@ man and M@@ R@@ Z@@ R@@ 4 ( S@@ M@@ R ) and innovative M@@ V@@ s , and innovative bee h@@ ole@@ s , which will guarantee movement of movement . we can also have a tab@@ oo after the 5@@ 0-@@ class we@@ ap@@ on@@ ic we@@ ap@@ on@@ ic .
before the arrival of the M@@ V@@ 700 and M@@ V@@ 700 , the Pol@@ ara has reached the army before the Pol@@ fer entered into the M@@ V@@ 700 market .
in the M@@ V@@ 700 case , it is the army of 7 000 in the Pol@@ ar@@ c T@@ w@@ in S@@ mar@@ ts@@ man , which has been included and has been added to a two-@@ party fuel tan@@ k , a two-@@ partial fuel tan@@ k , strengthened more inter@@ lo@@ cked , strengthened and the main , and yet some military equipment , which farmers or in the wild farmers in the wild are not going to be able to do more .
in the same way , as John De@@ ere M@@ -@@ G@@ ers successfully used in both Iraq and Afghanistan , it has been equipped with arms streng@@ ths and some other elements that are useless , but in the battle zone .
the ta@@ g of 750 kil@@ og@@ ram@@ s will be able to depri@@ ve almost its own body weight , or , in particular , 5@@ 70 kil@@ os degrees .
the motor capacity is also enough to make more ligh@@ t-@@ touch and me@@ mber@@ some parts of the motor .
in terms of the other images that are being made , it will make it possible to ta@@ p from the point A to B , which is the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of the size of a small but throw out .
later , the revised versions of A@@ 1 , A@@ 1 , which are 20 hor@@ bu@@ powerful M@@ -@@ G@@ as is more powerful , and this subsequent strengthened framework of A@@ 2 , which will be even better for the transportation and in@@ jec@@ tion , and A@@ 3 , which have the qualities of A@@ 1 and A@@ 2 positive characteristics .
the coming M@@ -@@ G@@ ers were actually in 1997 in 1997 and 1998 in Bosnia , in which medical pan@@ els used them to eva@@ cu@@ ate those w@@ ounded .
at the same time , they also reduced the burden of mobile soldiers , transported instead of them , which would otherwise have come to the market .
if the majority of the A@@ T@@ V@@ s of the A@@ T@@ V@@ s are used for civil consumption , there are also some exceptions .
the most significant spirit of those of P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x International in P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x International , which have been used successfully in the world &apos;s battle , intelligence and rescue missions , have been used by P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x International .
according to the manufacturer , for the first time they have been presented in the case of the bot@@ t@@ len@@ ec@@ ks that have been set up for the first time they have been presented and for carrying out special operations , which are typical of the traditional A@@ T@@ V@@ s and also those that are necessary for the army , both in terms of pre@@ dicta@@ bility , re@@ sili@@ ence and safety .
after being built and the highest way of the ordinary A@@ T@@ V@@ le , Pro@@ w@@ ler is on the basis of both its design and ca@@ pac@@ ity-@@ building .
it is faster , more stable , more stable , and it will be able to transported , after all , to be transported than other vehicles similar to them .
for example , if , in the case of ordinary A@@ TV , a leader in order to maintain the balance of the vehicle must constantly play a role and to use both hands in order to speed , speed up and delay both hands in order to speed up and delay both hands , rese@@ arch@@ ing with the management of a car .
however , at the end of the day , it is not a matter of whether Mr Pro@@ w@@ ler , G@@ ator , M@@ V@@ 8@@ 50 or a second second area of A@@ T@@ V or U@@ T@@ V or U@@ T@@ V , they are all like the same .
and it is clear that under circumstances where the defence expenditure is being reduced and , instead of a s@@ m@@ am@@ -@@ scale war instead of a fla@@ grant , a firm target of specific targets , it is ligh@@ t@@ weight and fast ligh@@ t@@ ings , are ligh@@ t@@ weight and fast ligh@@ t@@ ings to the army in order to stay in the service .
&apos;@@ T@@ my &apos;@@ clo@@ ck died , but I am not a &apos; , spar@@ k s@@ and , a s@@ mi@@ le s@@ mi@@ le in the 7@@ 0@@ 0.@@ 3 .
it is true that the R@@ ai@@ t R@@ ai@@ t la@@ cked behind the R@@ ai@@ vo@@ t .
moreover , you went to 2@@ 1.@@ 1 kilometres , she got off : &apos; I talked about one person in a time of a single person , a man in the drin@@ k and wonder : &apos; I@@ ss@@ ing , you are still talking about ! &apos;
J@@ oo@@ k distan@@ ced from the state of energy at a time of energy , some of the repeated has@@ ty has@@ s@@ wal@@ k .
the recommendation of T@@ re@@ en .
&apos;@@ A@@ pp@@ ar@@ in AL@@ A@@ R Ju@@ h@@ ans@@ has said that the moun@@ tains must wal@@ k , that there is no point to push for the drin@@ k because there is such rises and , in a short time , there is no difference , whether you drin@@ k or motor@@ ways , &apos; says &apos; or s@@ lee@@ p@@ wal@@ k words &apos; .
he has also been able to tighten up the b@@ ust of wal@@ king and , therefore , it was able to brea@@ the over the left and a better view of inter@@ views .
as was not the case , 1.@@ 9 kilometres flo@@ til@@ lation and 2@@ 1.@@ 1 kilometres of the drin@@ k and 2@@ 1.@@ 1 kilometres of the drin@@ k .
&apos;@@ I think that it is my training that I am also able to enjoy the &apos; , recognises &apos; in January , and to date , to date , the 16 kil@@ og@@ ram@@ s lost in their bodies .
and , as far as inter@@ views are concerned , this was my wish to be able to give an inter@@ view after inter@@ view in the re@@ fin@@ ing .
I have been able to inter@@ view inter@@ views after every competition , and I had hoped that it would be fu@@ r to have a lot of nonsense after the O@@ te@@ p@@ her I@@ train .
I thought that it would be well , if I am not in the wake of the Irish train &apos; ; on the other hand , to the end of the West to the west of the West , it was quite different to the end of the sky and , in the shape of the sky , a good victory in the sky .
there was also grounds for 46 minutes and 24 seconds , 90 kilometres , for 3 hours and 2@@ 1.@@ 1 kilometres and 18 minutes .
&apos;@@ my heart has now been given to the tri@@ at@@ lon@@ es &apos; , the Ra@@ id@@ o , who has already announced in the re@@ fin@@ ement , that it gave sport to war , and it took a war on the ground .
I have already registered herself of 20 August Gra@@ n F@@ on@@ dt , 2@@ 30 kilometres from T@@ all@@ a .
so tomorrow , you will be tr@@ usted again .
the third f@@ esti@@ val of the We@@ es@@ te third f@@ esti@@ val will send a strong wind .
so , in the face of the A@@ p@@ pro@@ ach , one of the wh@@ eel@@ s of the A@@ p@@ pro@@ ach who is trying to fly in the def@@ end@@ ants is in the c@@ abin@@ et .
because of the future , many of the f@@ esti@@ val gu@@ ar@@ gu@@ ar@@ gu@@ ar@@ gu@@ ar@@ gu@@ ar@@ gu@@ ar@@ gu@@ ar@@ gu@@ ar@@ gu@@ ar@@ gu@@ s are full of the s@@ and of the s@@ and .
I think we have gone quite well .
we have done well with our works and work &apos; , the P@@ business police leader in And@@ res S@@ hu@@ er , who has been involved in the first night of the We@@ e@@ en , has been involved in the first night .
it says that today , the pat@@ ro@@ l police and the rapid reactions are on the streets and also communicate with people - perhaps they have questions and want to know how to get a rapid response .
in two days , the police have had to deal with some bat@@ tles and also drug cases .
there are also some of the cases of a large number of nar@@ co@@ tic substances , but we will make a point when the We@@ e@@ re@@ n is over &apos; , it goes to S@@ humane .
the P@@ business police force has been going through around two hours in the space of two hours .
fortunately , the police have not been necessary to solve extreme cases .
by the way , it says that , if the sky has to be radically and horiz@@ on@@ tally hatred , they do not have a lot of work .
one of the police leader of the police has once said that rain is like supplementary in the case .
the P@@ business police have also made the necessary help to which things have been identified and there will also be the same way to demand their lost things .
by the way , the police even lost one of the necessary words , which have been delivered by the good people .
look at the vi@@ de@@ o@@ se , which has yet been mentioned in And@@ res S@@ human to the A@@ n .
the We@@ al@@ a f@@ esti@@ val G@@ un@@ na@@ r , Mr G@@ un@@ na@@ r , talks about the A@@ p@@ pro@@ ach , that f@@ esti@@ val took a back back from Finland , and its owners went back under the coast of the coast , a stop in the P@@ business and this was sold in Estonia .
G@@ un@@ na@@ r is saying that they have committed to 25 000 visiting a day , but tic@@ kets will only be regarded as a f@@ esti@@ val through .
the preparation for the streets has already started in September .

it was stated that the S@@ pressures have announced that it does not make a statement on what happened .

the delicate data of the vulnerable children who have been published were published as a result of the pro@@ ph@@ al@@ y of care@@ lessness .
as a result of the worrying violation of information relating to information , there was a child &apos;s personal data , including information about whether they are sexu@@ ally active .
there was a proposal for an e-@@ mail , which included the names of the names of children who are operating in the city of V@@ ic@@ tor@@ ia , the bir@@ ths , the place of bir@@ ths , location , and specific concerns and points requiring attention .
e-@@ mail revealed the habi@@ ta@@ ts of every child .
it has been pointed out that one of a 13@@ -@@ year-old bo@@ y is exempt from the ba@@ il and , in the case of her , sexual behaviour is expressed in that one 15@@ -@@ year-old gir@@ l , who have problems with self-@@ injuries , the abuse of certain substances and dis@@ current , is &apos; bo@@ y friend &apos; and &apos; no &apos; this evening &apos; , and that one in a 14@@ -@@ year-old bo@@ y will need aid &apos; , and that one in a 14@@ -@@ year-old bo@@ y will need aid &apos; , and that one in a 14@@ -@@ year-old bo@@ y will need aid &apos; , and is bloody and physi@@ cally threatened .
the tab@@ oo seems to be a transfer document that was intended to be the guardian of the super@@ vis@@ or .
the document contains notes about when it will be to wait for some children to wait or whether they can make contact with personnel .
there are a worrying number of details about a few children .
there has been a warning about the 15@@ -year bo@@ y : &apos; if the staff take a Community in order to obtain authorisation and / or , / or excessive sexual material for the revision of the / US@@ S@@ B@@ -@@ law / US@@ S@@ B , this authorisation must be authorised &apos; .
the document also makes it known that a 17@@ -@@ year-old gir@@ l , who receives 18 months after only three months after 18 and release , is the risk of suicide in the event of a great deal of personnel in the event that the personnel will have to call for an urgent emergency immediately in the event of his refugee .
it was stated that it is outside and &apos; will be excluded from the personnel &apos; , and &apos; will be in touch with the personnel &apos; in order to give him a &apos; .
although it has only been mentioned in the case of the places listed , where children are kept , and not in their address , the details are still enough enough to be able to find them .
the data leakage in 2015 came to the mother , with F@@ air@@ fa@@ x , with the ME@@ IA@@ IA@@ x of their experience in the contacts between health and slo@@ ts and the protection of child protection , since taking his da@@ u@@ gh@@ e to four years ago .
he agreed to share its concerns now when his da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter had obtained 18 and left systems .
the hear@@ t-@@ breaking decision to give more than child protection over child protection received at home after a violent incident at home , the case is one of ever more anti-@@ domestic complaints , the parents are putting their children on their children .
it had the alarming consequences that the mother had never imag@@ ined , for example , he was able to get a da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter in six months after leaving seven criminal charges , it was moving to hundreds of mi@@ les away from the distant and old age , where he appeared successfully in the face of the ba@@ g , but then moved back to them without informing the old , but were moving back to them without informing them , but were moving back to them without informing them , but then moving back to their da@@ u@@ gh@@ e and the relationship between his da@@ u@@ gh@@ e and the old man .
the relationship with the chairs of these bo@@ y friends , 17@@ -@@ year-old , with whom the institutions of the 15 years of 15 years of 15 years to attend a regular ho@@ tel have ended in a regular ho@@ tel ended in a regular ho@@ tel , after the age of 18 years after the age of 18 years after the age of 18 years after the age of 18 after 18 years after the age of 18 after 18 years after the age of 18 after 18 years after the age of 18 .
&apos;@@ W@@ hat she emer@@ ges from the system in a worse situation than when entering it ? &apos; is the mother .
&apos;@@ , and does this happen with all the care@@ lessness of the child ?
he is in favour of the creation of such an institution , which would allow health and service minis@@ tries to observe children during the first weeks after their care , before they are relo@@ cated to their homes .
this would allow them to better understand how children are communic@@ ating with others and which are associated with the risks and their needs , especially in education .
the State government is looking for new ways of reducing the need to put children into domestic care , in an attempt to better support their parents .
a definite guide@@ line of aid packages financed by EUR 62 million in four years is aimed at helping to transfer children from domestic care to situations in a better manner .
in addition , the 5.@@ 6 million experim@@ ental experim@@ ent , which was made public last October , provide professionals to at least 28 children in order to help them get out of welfare or to prevent it .
according to the representative of the depart@@ ment , information was not announced officially when it happened , although the mother claims that two parts of the staff have been informed in a few months after the incident .
the depart@@ ment is now cooperating with the provider in order to analyse the case .
&apos;@@ Y@@ ou are being taken very seriously in every case , and we are working to ensure that it has not adver@@ sely affected the young people concerned .
in July last year , the election of the child &apos;s privacy incident during five years of the five-year period of the family and the children of children and children over the five years has been subject to an independent over@@ haul .
the depart@@ ment agreed to the seven recommendations that have been tabled and , after this child safety instructions , have been renewed , to ensure that personnel will clearly understand its roles and privacy , have called IT systems in order to ban the automatic concentration of certain personal data , and we have formally looked at the services relating to privacy .

the German authorities believe that T@@ rin@@ h X@@ u@@ an T@@ han@@ h was seized from Berlin , which left to 48 hours on Wednesday , to leave the country .
T@@ han@@ h is facing charges of ownership , which is the death penalty in the event of conviction .
he sought asylum from Germany , but his statement was not yet to be worked through when the Vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese authorities called for her extradition .
Mrs Han@@ g said to re@@ por@@ ters from the Vietnam Foreign Affairs De@@ part@@ ment in Vietnam that these comments have been &apos; extremely regrettable &apos; and T@@ han@@ h gave herself to the police in Vietnam on 31 July .
&apos;@@ Vietnam must always be important and wants to develop strategic relations with Germany &apos; , he said in the detail .
T@@ han@@ h , 51 , last July after she had been charged with dis@@ honest management of national oil and ga@@ in@@ et@@ Vi@@ Vi@@ et@@ Vietnam , which brought about USD 150 million to the tune of the USD 150 million .
the Vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese police issued a arrest warrant in September .
in March , the police initiated investigations in order to investigate ownership in connection with his alleged participation in the property mar@@ ty@@ tic development project .
T@@ han@@ h was the Chairman of Mr S@@ to@@ ck Cor@@ por@@ a Cor@@ por@@ a Cor@@ por@@ ov to 2013 , when he was appointed in the government to a number of prisoners in the government , including the Chairman of the Pro@@ v@@ ince of the Pro@@ v@@ ince of the Pro@@ v@@ ince of the Pro@@ v@@ ince of the Pro@@ v@@ ince of the Pro@@ v@@ ince .

the results of investigations show that the car@@ ca@@ s are also spreading se@@ eds .
like the bir@@ ds and m@@ am@@ m@@ als , the car@@ ro@@ ts are also spreading .
these in@@ sec@@ ts are known primarily as a la@@ yer who will help to disman@@ tle substances under forest .
it is also , however , also helping to dis@@ solve the se@@ eds .
Japanese researchers have discovered that the car@@ ca@@ ust has an important role to play in the distribution of se@@ eds of se@@ eds .
this is an unusual plant .
it does not include a g@@ lor@@ ro@@ p , which is why it is not capable of photo@@ graph@@ ic .
instead , the species of its nutri@@ ent can be used in an increase .
T@@ ai@@ m po@@ s@@ s little on the foundations of small fra@@ gran@@ ces and po@@ ole@@ less white fruit .
there is a great deal of tas@@ te in Vil@@ hunting or it is not gender , and Japanese researchers felt that poultry and m@@ am@@ m@@ als are not interested in their food source .
only the B@@ la@@ t@@ tel@@ la ni@@ ps in the B@@ la@@ t@@ tel@@ la ni@@ p in B@@ la@@ t@@ tel@@ la , B@@ la@@ t@@ tel@@ la ni@@ p , were the only form that has been carried out on a regular basis .
investi@@ g@@ ators have been checked in the emissions of prin@@ ted emissions in order to as@@ certain whether these in@@ sec@@ ts will help to spread se@@ eds .
researchers felt that , on average , the B@@ e@@ p@@ pro@@ ach has been included in one after three .
further tests have confirmed that most of the se@@ eds of these se@@ eds were viable .
researchers are expected that this unique plant &apos;s eli@@ tes have probably learnt the ability to exploit the se@@ eds of car@@ r@@ ust se@@ eds .
we are bo@@ ther@@ ers on the ground near time and they are ready at the same time as the car@@ ro@@ ts are getting out of their counter@@ part .
the investi@@ g@@ ators expressed their findings this week in the press in B@@ our@@ ne@@ an J@@ our@@ nal .
&apos;@@ in view of the fact that around 4 600 car@@ ca@@ c@@ ali@@ k has been identified so far , the distribution of se@@ eds could be much more extensive and , until now , simply an un@@ documented mechanism , not merely a unique element of a safe plant with a unique design of a safe plant in the form of a safe plant , a press release in the press release of Na@@ o@@ to Su@@ gi@@ ur@@ a , the University of the K@@ um@@ am@@ o@@ to University .
it is hoped that the public households encourage people to focus more attention on relations between plants and car@@ ca@@ cal@@ e and to seek even more examples of how the car@@ ro@@ t se@@ eds are spread &apos; .
F@@ l@@ y@@ gen presented a report on the publication of information , which shows additional payments .
Mr F@@ l@@ y@@ ro , who served for a short time to the President of the President of the National Security Council , tabled a report on Thursday , which contains new details on F@@ l@@ y@@ n contracts in relation to the re@@ si@@ d@@ ential re@@ si@@ d@@ ent of the re@@ si@@ d@@ ential re@@ si@@ d@@ ential , the company company , and the campaign for the business of the commercial company , which has worked with the parent company &apos;s parent company .
in writing . - ( NL ) The report sent out information , Mr F@@ l@@ y@@ so-called , mentioned that his initial publication reports have been put forward without the usual consultation and survey provided by the White House and Government on the basis of the E@@ th@@ ics Office .
according to the letter , F@@ l@@ y@@ so-called parts could not receive the other possible compli@@ cations , because she was no longer in the White House for the White House .
Mr F@@ l@@ y@@ so-called abandoned his office in just 24 days after I took the rum@@ ours that he had given Vice-President P@@ en@@ ce to his post-@@ electoral links with the Russian amb@@ assador in the United States .
F@@ l@@ y@@ so-called has also gained criticism because of external payments , which have been removed from the position of the agency in the private sector at a time of work in 2014 .
in the past , the information provided to investi@@ g@@ ators in the House of Represen@@ ta@@ tives declared that the cost and disbur@@ sement of some 68 000 dollars in 2015 were declared to be reported in 2015 .
in addition to the income in Russia , on Thursday , the information provided to be that F@@ l@@ y@@ so-called has received at least USD 5 000 for a consultation project for the construction of nuclear power plants .
the work of F@@ l@@ y@@ n@@ n has already been published before the project , but it was not known that he was paid for it .
the renewed information also confirms that the F@@ l@@ y@@ ro had agreed to cooperate with the S@@ C@@ L G@@ ro@@ u@@ p - at the time C@@ amb@@ ri@@ dge L@@ al@@ y@@ tic@@ a British &apos;s parent company - or the D@@ on@@ al@@ d An@@ al@@ y@@ tic@@ k on the basis of data on data science .
