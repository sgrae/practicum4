is there finally some relief from an@@ no@@ ying ro@@ bo@@ calls ?
for Michael R@@ iz@@ z@@ o , answering the phone is too often a waste of time .
his S@@ ports City pi@@ z@@ za pu@@ b in Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , New York , depends on customers calling to order w@@ ings , pi@@ z@@ za and po@@ ta@@ to s@@ kin@@ s .
but much of the time , it &apos;s an automa@@ ted message pushing a sca@@ m .
&quot; it &apos;s getting to the point where it &apos;s blocking other cal@@ lers from coming in , &quot; the 2@@ 4-@@ year-old ba@@ r ow@@ ner said .
help is coming , if slowly .
over the past year , pro@@ d@@ ded by the government , c@@ ell@@ phones have added new tools to countera@@ ct un@@ wanted &quot; ro@@ bo@@ calls . &quot;
the Federal Commun@@ ic@@ ations Commission has proposed le@@ tting phone companies block more spa@@ m and is hoping to de@@ ter sc@@ am@@ mers with big fines .
experts say these steps are not a cu@@ re-@@ all , but they &apos;@@ re a good start .
the federal and state &quot; D@@ o N@@ ot C@@ all &quot; lists are supposed to protect people from un@@ wanted calls from tele@@ marke@@ ters .
but sc@@ am@@ mers don &apos;t care about breaking the law .
S@@ cam@@ mers reach people cheap@@ ly and easily using &quot; auto@@ di@@ al@@ ers , &quot; which spe@@ w out a large number of calls automatically .
it &apos;s estimated that Americans receive tens of millions of ro@@ bo@@ calls every day .
not all of them are fra@@ ud@@ sters , of course .
pharma@@ cies send automa@@ ted messages about prescri@@ ptions being filled .
but too often , it &apos;s this : you owe the I@@ RS money ; it &apos;s Mic@@ ro@@ soft calling to fix your computer ; free cru@@ ises !
and spa@@ m cal@@ lers have tri@@ cky technology that makes a phone &apos;s cal@@ ler I@@ D display a local or impor@@ tan@@ t-@@ looking cal@@ ler , like the I@@ RS .
cra@@ cking down on &quot; spo@@ of@@ ed &quot; numbers would make running a sca@@ m more difficult and save U@@ .@@ S@@ . consumers millions of dollars , a group of state at@@ tor@@ ne@@ ys general said in an f@@ c@@ c fil@@ ing .
phone companies and independent A@@ pp@@ s can scre@@ en or block un@@ wanted calls by checking them against databases of known problem numbers and analy@@ zing sus@@ pi@@ cious beha@@ vi@@ or , like a number that &apos;s calling lots of people on D@@ o N@@ ot C@@ all lists .
wi@@ re@@ less carriers also have tools that flag in@@ coming calls with warnings like &quot; sca@@ m likely , &quot; but they are@@ n &apos;t available on all phones , or to many pre@@ paid customers .
the versions from V@@ eri@@ z@@ on and s@@ print cost extra .
a few And@@ ro@@ id phones , including Google &apos;s Pi@@ x@@ el , scre@@ en spa@@ m calls for free .
J@@ en V@@ ar@@ gas , 39 , a multi@@ media producer from Orlando , F@@ l@@ ori@@ da , said her A@@ T &amp; T A@@ p@@ p flags and blocks some fraudulent calls to her c@@ ell@@ phone , but she &apos;s given up with the land@@ line .
&quot; very rarely do I pick up a call from a number I don &apos;t know , &quot; V@@ ar@@ gas said .
A@@ pp@@ s including Y@@ ou@@ Ma@@ il and N@@ om@@ o@@ rob@@ o offer relief on home phones for free , with limitations .
with Y@@ ou@@ Ma@@ il , your carri@@ er must allow &quot; conditional call forwarding , &quot; which forwards calls if a line is un@@ answered or bus@@ y .
N@@ om@@ o@@ rob@@ o is@@ n &apos;t available through all home phone providers and won &apos;t work with older , cop@@ per@@ -based land@@ lines .
you can also buy g@@ ad@@ gets , some pretty cl@@ un@@ ky , that block calls on home phones .
V@@ eri@@ z@@ on is also testing warnings about sus@@ pi@@ cious calls on a home phone &apos;s cal@@ ler I@@ D display .
phone companies can already block some calls that are being fa@@ ked .
the f@@ c@@ c has proposed rules to form@@ ali@@ ze that practice and permit them to block other calls they suspect are sc@@ ams .
that means V@@ eri@@ z@@ on can block a tol@@ l-@@ free number that accepts calls for a bank but never initi@@ ates a call .
carriers would also be able to block calls they know are@@ n &apos;t legitimate , like a number with a 9@@ 11 area code .
the rules still need to be fin@@ ali@@ zed .
M@@ au@@ re@@ en Ma@@ honey , a public policy fellow at the non@@ profit Consu@@ mers Union , said the development is &quot; promising , &quot; but won &apos;t protect consumers from all un@@ wanted calls .
for one thing , &quot; D@@ o N@@ ot C@@ all &quot; lists don &apos;t apply to certain types of cal@@ lers , such as debt collec@@ tors and political campaigns .
in addition , Ma@@ honey said , the f@@ c@@ c rules would cover only fa@@ ked numbers .
not all ro@@ bo@@ calls are spo@@ of@@ ed .
consumers Union wants phone companies to make c@@ all@@ -@@ blocking tools available to all consumers for free .
in the longer term , the f@@ c@@ c supports industry efforts to verify that cal@@ lers are really who they say they are .
perhaps one day , you &apos;@@ ll see a green che@@ ck@@ mark on your smar@@ t@@ phone when the cal@@ ler is legitimate .
U@@ .@@ S@@ . Tele@@ com , the ph@@ one-@@ company lobby , says rolling this out could take a few years , but would prove powerful against ro@@ bo@@ cal@@ lers .
the f@@ c@@ c is also seeking ways to stop an@@ no@@ ying calls from dog@@ ging consumers when they change numbers .
today , if you sign up for D@@ o N@@ ot C@@ all but then get a new number , a marke@@ ter may not know and could p@@ es@@ ter you on your new line .
&quot; R@@ ob@@ oc@@ alle@@ rs are@@ n &apos;t going away , &quot; said A@@ ar@@ on F@@ os@@ s of N@@ om@@ o@@ rob@@ o , a c@@ all@@ -@@ blocking service for c@@ ell@@ phones and home phones .
&quot; these gu@@ ys are criminals and they &apos;@@ re going to find their way around any system .
but it &apos;s our job to make sure we make it as difficult for them as possible . &quot;
there are common@@ -@@ sense measures for consumers to follow .
don &apos;t answer the phone if you don &apos;t reco@@ g@@ ni@@ ze the number .
yes , this is im@@ practical on business phone lines , like S@@ ports City &apos;s .
han@@ g up on un@@ wanted cal@@ lers .
don &apos;t talk to them or press any bu@@ t@@ t@@ ons .
if you engage with them , they might flag you as someone who &apos;s respon@@ sive and in@@ un@@ date you with more calls .
block the number after the call , if possible .
use c@@ all@@ -@@ blocking A@@ pp@@ s .
if you have privacy concerns , check the A@@ p@@ p &apos;s policy to see if it &apos;s sharing your call or contacts data with marke@@ ters .
don &apos;t give cal@@ lers personal information , like bank account or Social Security numbers .
United Nor@@ de@@ a and D@@ N@@ B bank to become reality at end of year
the mer@@ ger of D@@ N@@ B and Nor@@ de@@ a Baltic units into a financial group called Lu@@ minor will become a reality in the last quarter of the year , Ä@@ ri@@ p@@ ä@@ e@@ v reports .
opening its doors as a single legal corpor@@ ation has been postponed several times .
after publication of mer@@ ger plans last summer , the banks indicated that the completion of the transaction might fall into the second quarter .
in April , however , D@@ N@@ B &apos;s head of communications said it would be postponed to the third quarter .
namely , the Swedish Financial Super@@ vision Authority gave Lu@@ minor additional instructions to be fulfilled , given the reg@@ inal importance of the united bank .
Russian railway looking into possibility of launching S@@ t@@ . Peter@@ s@@ bur@@ g@@ -@@ Kal@@ in@@ ing@@ ra@@ d-@@ Berlin passenger train
a Russian railway is looking into the possibility of launching a S@@ t@@ . Peter@@ s@@ bur@@ g@@ -@@ Berlin train line that would go via Kal@@ in@@ ing@@ rad , Kal@@ in@@ ing@@ rad Railway director Vik@@ tor G@@ ol@@ om@@ ol@@ z@@ in told Inter@@ fa@@ x Se@@ ve@@ ro-@@ Z@@ a@@ pa@@ d .
passenger traffic monitoring shows that from the economic standpoint , it is barely possible to restore Kal@@ in@@ ing@@ ra@@ d-@@ Berlin train service .
and we are offering another route - Ber@@ lin@@ -@@ Kal@@ in@@ ing@@ ra@@ d-@@ S@@ t . Peter@@ s@@ burg .
the technical possibilities for this exist in regard to both infrastructure and rolling stock , &quot; said G@@ ol@@ om@@ ol@@ z@@ in .
G@@ ol@@ om@@ ol@@ z@@ in also noted that there already exist Russian trains that can switch rail ga@@ u@@ ge and continue travel on the European track ga@@ u@@ ge .
G@@ ol@@ om@@ ol@@ z@@ in believes this path is promising , as currently inhabitants of S@@ t@@ . Peter@@ s@@ burg and all of nor@@ th@@ west part of Russia have to go through Moscow and B@@ rest when travelling to Germany .
a route through Latvia is being discussed as a possible vari@@ ant , Latvian Ra@@ il@@ ways ( L@@ at@@ vi@@ j@@ as D@@ z@@ el@@ s@@ ce@@ ļ@@ š ) press representative M@@ ā@@ ris O@@ z@@ ols confirmed to Latvian Del@@ f@@ i , saying that there is currently no concrete decision but that the vari@@ ant is under discussion .
Latvian Ra@@ il@@ ways and its partners , including Russian Ra@@ il@@ ways , is looking for a possibility to increase competitiveness in servi@@ cing passenger flows , so that railway transport could compete with road transport .
Chinese firm that came to Estonia last year immediately posts 100 million euro turnover
the Ch@@ ine@@ se-@@ owned agricultural produce selle@@ r A@@ g@@ ri@@ tera , which launched operations only last year , at@@ tained a turnover of nearly 100 million euros
close to 2 million euros in profit was earned , Ä@@ ri@@ p@@ ä@@ e@@ v reports .

1.@@ 91 million euros in profit was earned .
the company was not in business a year earlier .
the company employed an average of 3 people last year . it had no employees in 2015 .
turnover per employee was 3@@ 3.@@ 6 million euros and the average gross pay was 3@@ 16 euros per month .
we already have a four@@ -@@ day work week , but not the kind we want
open office . photo@@ g@@ raph : S@@ can@@ pi@@ x , Pan@@ ther@@ Me@@ dia / Wa@@ ve@@ break@@ media L@@ t@@ d
Un@@ be@@ kno@@ w@@ n@@ st to them , many Est@@ on@@ i@@ ans already have the four@@ -@@ day work week they cra@@ ve .
yet it &apos;s not the kind they would want , reports Ä@@ ri@@ p@@ ä@@ e@@ v .
it is a product of modern office planning - in other words , an open office .
according to the pres@@ ti@@ gi@@ ous management perio@@ di@@ cal H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard Business Review , an employee in an office without walls sp@@ ends close to 1.5 hours a day - almost an entire work day per week - doing nothing .
yet while a four@@ -@@ day work week usually is taken to mean four days at work and three days off , this sort of forced solution is inf@@ eri@@ or to it .
instead of being spent with family or on ho@@ b@@ bies or rec@@ u@@ per@@ ating , the 1.5 hours taken away from working time consists of problems concentrating , inter@@ rup@@ tions of work , increasing irri@@ tation and anxi@@ ety and problems , dimin@@ ished motivation for working .
how to finance company vehicles ?
the changes in the consumer society have resulted in expanded possibilities for financing company vehicles - besides ordinary le@@ asing , more and more companies are using full-@@ service le@@ asing or long-term car ren@@ tals , which imposes fewer obligations .
le@@ asing and car h@@ ire are two clearly different financial transactions , which involve different sorts of obligations and expectations but which often cause confusion .
the Est@@ onian sale and marketing director of international car ren@@ tal company a@@ vis Vil@@ li T@@ õ@@ l@@ d said companies were visi@@ bly moving toward full-@@ service le@@ asing and increasingly using the option of long-term car h@@ ire .
T@@ õ@@ l@@ d cited the main questions that can be answered to choose the suitable means of using a vehicle .
how long to use the car ?
the biggest difference between ren@@ ting and le@@ asing a car is the term of use .
&quot; it is wise to prefer le@@ asing for longer use of a vehicle if the company plans to make use of the company vehicles for a longer term , &quot; explained T@@ õ@@ l@@ d , adding that it would be wise to opt for ordinary le@@ asing if the desire is to own the car , while full-@@ service le@@ asing or long-term car h@@ ire if one wishes to use the vehicle as a service - i.e. using the car every day but leaving the maintenance obligations to the service provider and giving up title to the car .
&quot; a ren@@ tal car has a significantly shorter period of use than a le@@ asing period , but many major car ren@@ tal firms also offer long-term car h@@ ire , as ren@@ ting a car is free of complicated contracts and the car can be returned at any time , &quot; said T@@ õ@@ l@@ d in deta@@ iling the different possibilities of ren@@ ting a car .
who becomes the car ow@@ ner ?
upon the end of an ordinary le@@ asing contract , the les@@ see becomes the car ow@@ ner .
&quot; in the case of full-@@ service le@@ asing , it is possible at the end of the le@@ asing period to continue the le@@ ase payment on the same or better conditions , getting in its place an equivalent new vehicle that meets the company &apos;s needs , &quot; he said , empha@@ siz@@ ing that as consumer society is moving increasingly toward servi@@ ce-@@ centred consumption , ownership of a vehicle is an additional obligation for the company .
in addition , full-@@ service le@@ asing comes with the option of buying the car on ag@@ re@@ ed@@ -@@ upon conditions , if this is desired .
there is no such possibility when ren@@ ting and only the period of use is paid for .
le@@ asing a car generally takes place at deal@@ er@@ ships and au@@ to rent takes place in the ren@@ tal office of a car ren@@ tal firm .
deal@@ er@@ ships do primarily sell cars , but they also offer le@@ asing and , in some cases , car ren@@ tal .
ren@@ tal companies , however , have the exclusive objective of h@@ ir@@ ing out cars .
T@@ õ@@ l@@ d said that the reasons for using ren@@ tal service are different - many companies h@@ ire company cars ; in addition , it is convenient to use the service on business stri@@ ps or while on holiday or if one &apos;s own car is in the shop .
&quot; in the case of company cars , there an increasing chan@@ ge@@ over to full-@@ service le@@ asing , which gi@@ bes the custom@@ er transparency of costs , savings on time in the car buying , use and return process , and more convenience , &quot; said the sales and marketing director regarding the growing le@@ asing trend .
each year , more and more companies are using full-@@ service le@@ asing for their fleet of cars , thus opti@@ mi@@ zing their spending and focusing on their main activity .
what is the servi@@ ce@@ -based insurance coverage like ?
while in the case of a lea@@ sed car , comprehensive and T@@ PL motor insurance are obligatory , ren@@ tal cars usually are covered by basic insurance with the additional decision to be made of op@@ ting for accident insurance , the@@ ft or comprehensive insurance . &quot; if we compare ordinary le@@ asing with full-@@ service le@@ asing , the custom@@ er gets a more for an equivalent monthly payment , as in addition to the vehicle and in@@ sur@@ ances , the monthly payment also covers regular maintenance , 2@@ 4@@ h breakdown assistance , ty@@ re changes and other agreed services , &quot; explained T@@ õ@@ l@@ d .
&quot; while any vehicle can be chosen for an ordinary le@@ ase , in the case of full-@@ service le@@ asing , the service provider helps choose a car that meets the company &apos;s needs and wishes , taking into account the usage func@@ tionality as well , &quot; he said in comparison , stressing that full-@@ service le@@ asing will definitely help to opti@@ mi@@ ze the spending related to the company &apos;s motor fleet .
&quot; the selection of ren@@ tal cars however depends on the service provider &apos;s car h@@ ire fleet - different ren@@ tal companies &quot; fleets offer both small and econom@@ ical vehicles for city traffic and lu@@ x@@ u@@ ri@@ ous ones for business meetings , &quot; described T@@ õ@@ l@@ d .
during a bus@@ y ren@@ tal period , of course , it may happen that the desired car is ren@@ ted out , but making an early boo@@ king helps counter this .
when choosing between le@@ asing or ren@@ ting , first one should get clear on one &apos;s goals - how long a time one wishes to use the vehicle for , and what are the long-term plans in connection with the car .
certainly , it would be wise to famili@@ ari@@ ze one@@ self with the different conditions and obligations of the services .
how one man built a $ 5@@ 1@@ m theme par@@ k for his da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter
a father from T@@ ex@@ as realised there were no theme par@@ ks where his disabled da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter could play .
so he decided to build one .
Gordon H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N had just got out of the sw@@ im@@ ming pool on a family holiday , when his 12-@@ year-old da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter Morgan went up to some children playing in the water .
she tried to make friends with them but they quickly left the pool .
H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N thinks they shi@@ ed away from her because they di@@ d@@ n &apos;t know how to react to someone with a disability - Morgan has the co@@ g@@ ni@@ tive understanding of a fi@@ ve-@@ year-old as well as a form of au@@ tis@@ m .
the incident played on his mind .
&quot; Morgan is just a wonderful young la@@ dy .
when you meet her you will always get a s@@ mi@@ le and she will always want to offer a hu@@ g .
but there were so many times we cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;t take her places , &quot; he says .
H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N and his wife Mag@@ gi@@ e asked other parents where they could take their da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter - somewhere she would feel comfortable , and others would feel comfortable intera@@ cting with her .
&quot; we realised such an inclusive place di@@ d@@ n &apos;t exist , &quot; says H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N .
so in 2007 he decided to build it himself .
a former property de@@ vel@@ o@@ per , he sold his home@@ building businesses in 2005 to set up The Gordon H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N Fam@@ ily Foundation , a non-@@ profit organisation that seeks to help people with disabilities .
then he set about creating the &quot; world &apos;s first ul@@ tra-@@ accessible theme par@@ k . &quot;
&quot; we wanted a theme par@@ k where everyone could do everything , where people with and without special needs could play , &quot; H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N says .
he brought together doctors , ther@@ ap@@ ists , parents and other people with and without disabilities to consult on the facilities .
these were built on the 2@@ 5-@@ ac@@ re site of a dis@@ used quar@@ ry in San An@@ ton@@ i@@ o , T@@ ex@@ as .
the par@@ k , called Morgan &apos;s W@@ on@@ der@@ land , cost $ 3@@ 4@@ m ( £ 2@@ 6@@ m ) and opened in 2010 .
attra@@ ctions include a ful@@ ly-@@ accessible Fer@@ ris whe@@ el , ad@@ venture pla@@ y@@ ground and min@@ i@@ a@@ ture train .
visitors regularly tell H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N it is the first time they &apos;@@ ve been able to experience such attra@@ ctions .
there is also a ca@@ rou@@ sel with speci@@ ally designed ch@@ ari@@ ots for wh@@ eel@@ chairs that go up and down alongside the animals .
however , H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N reveals Morgan was at first w@@ ary of the ride .
&quot; when we opened she was too sca@@ red to go on it .
she di@@ d@@ n &apos;t understand why it was going around and the animals were going up and down , &quot; H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N says .
it was three years before Morgan would go on the ca@@ rou@@ sel .
&quot; first she would stand near it , then she &apos;@@ d get on an animal but we w@@ oul@@ d@@ n &apos;t start it .
it was a slow process but now she lo@@ ves going on it .
overcoming something she was sca@@ red of meant a lot to her .
little things achieved in play can make a big difference . &quot;
since it opened Morgan &apos;s W@@ on@@ der@@ land has received over a million visitors from 67 countries and from all 50 American states .
a third of staff have disabilities and entr@@ ance is free to any gu@@ est with a condition .
&quot; I realised Morgan was one of the lu@@ cky ones because she had many of the things she needed .
I di@@ d@@ n &apos;t want cost to be a barrier for others with special needs , &quot; H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N says .
&quot; we open every year knowing we &apos;@@ re going to lose over $ 1@@ m ( £ 7@@ 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 ) and we need to recover that through fun@@ dra@@ ising and partners . &quot;
this year , the theme par@@ k was expanded with the opening of Morgan &apos;s inspiration Is@@ land , a ful@@ ly-@@ accessible water par@@ k .
&quot; fewer people were visiting in July because the wh@@ eel@@ chairs got too hot .
so we decided to create a water par@@ k next door , &quot; H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N says .
parts of the island use warm water , which helps visitors with mus@@ cular problems .
water@@ proof motor@@ ised wh@@ eel@@ chairs are provided , which run on com@@ pressed air rather than bat@@ teri@@ es .
there is also an accessible river boat ride .
altogether , the water par@@ k cost $ 17@@ m ( £ 13@@ m ) .
&quot; yesterday a man came up to me at inspiration Is@@ land and just held my hand , &quot; H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N says .
&quot; he pointed to his son , who has acute special needs and started c@@ rying .
he said he ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t been able to play in water before . &quot;
H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N says three out of four visitors to the par@@ k are not disabled , and that the par@@ k is having precisely the effect he hoped for .
&quot; it helps people realise that though we are different in some ways , actually we are all the same , &quot; he says .
&quot; I saw one gir@@ l in a wh@@ eel@@ chair go up to another gir@@ l without special needs , and they began playing together .
that was really c@@ ool . &quot;
H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N is@@ n &apos;t planning to open any more par@@ ks , despite receiving hundreds of letters and ema@@ ils from people who want one in their own area .
instead he is focusing on providing educational facilities to teen@@ ag@@ ers with special needs in San An@@ ton@@ i@@ o .
&quot; I know there are a lot of different organisations trying to build something like Morgan &apos;s W@@ on@@ der@@ land elsewhere and we &apos;@@ ll continue to work with them , &quot; he adds .
he continues to take Morgan along to play at the theme par@@ k , where she is now something of a celeb@@ rity .
&quot; when she comes here she &apos;s a ro@@ ck sta@@ r !
lots of people want to talk to her and take her picture , she &apos;s very good with it , &quot; H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N says .
now 23 , Morgan continues to go from strength to strength .
&quot; she talks more now and most of her physical issues have been taken care of through numerous sur@@ g@@ eries .
we &apos;@@ re so proud of how far she has come . &quot;
when Morgan visits she &apos;s ha@@ p@@ pi@@ est playing on the sw@@ ings and in the s@@ and zone , unaware of just how much she has helped others .
&quot; Morgan knows the par@@ k is named after her , but I don &apos;t think she understands the magnitude of what it represents and how it &apos;s changed lives , &quot; H@@ AR@@ T@@ M@@ A@@ N says .
&quot; she do@@ es@@ n &apos;t realise how she has dealt with things in life has made her a true inspiration . &quot;
bid to tra@@ ce drivers after gir@@ l ra@@ ped twice in W@@ it@@ ton
police want to tra@@ ce the drivers of two cars as part of an investigation into the rape of a 14@@ -@@ year-old gir@@ l .
the teen@@ ager was attacked in the W@@ it@@ ton area of B@@ ir@@ ming@@ ha@@ m at about 02 : 00 B@@ S@@ T on 26 July .
prior to that attack , she was ra@@ ped at W@@ it@@ ton station .
a man has been charged in connection with the first incident .
British Transport Police would like to speak to two drivers as part of their investigation .
police said the first car is a light col@@ oured sal@@ o@@ on@@ -@@ type vehicle .
de@@ t C@@ H@@ F in@@ s@@ p T@@ ony F@@ it@@ z@@ pat@@ ric@@ k said : &quot; we believe the driver of this vehicle spoke to the victim outside the station , prior to her being pic@@ ked up by another person who then ra@@ ped her in a car .
we &apos;@@ d like to know what was said during the conver@@ sation , and it may be that the driver can provide us with some vital details which will help our in@@ quiries . &quot;
the driver of the second vehicle , described as a red V@@ W S@@ har@@ an , is believed to have given the victim a lift home after she was ra@@ ped a second time , police said .
Can@@ cer@@ -@@ nur@@ sing c@@ at gen@@ i@@ e named c@@ at of the Year
a rescue c@@ at that helped its ow@@ ner through b@@ one cancer treatment has been named National c@@ at of the Year .
gen@@ i@@ e was honoured for comfor@@ ting her ow@@ ner E@@ vi@@ e H@@ end@@ er@@ son , 11 , from L@@ inc@@ ol@@ n , through six roun@@ ds of ch@@ emo@@ ther@@ ap@@ y .
E@@ vi@@ e was diagno@@ sed with b@@ one cancer in March 201@@ 6 and said gen@@ i@@ e &apos;s company helped her cope with several painful operations and long spe@@ l@@ ls in hospital .
the c@@ at was recognised by fel@@ ine ch@@ arity ca@@ ts Protection at a ceremony in London .
image cap@@ tion E@@ vi@@ e said her c@@ at supported her when she lost her long bro@@ wn ha@@ ir while receiving ch@@ emo@@ ther@@ ap@@ y
&quot; I think she &apos;s great .
she deserves it .
she &apos;s always been there for me , &quot; said E@@ vi@@ e .
&quot; she would come round my le@@ g with the p@@ las@@ ter and she would sit by my feet .
she would s@@ me@@ ll my p@@ las@@ ter and she &apos;@@ d come up on to the sof@@ a and do pit@@ ter-@@ pat@@ ter on my kne@@ e .
when I &apos;@@ ve been too ill to have friends round or go outside and I &apos;@@ ve been stuck in the house , she &apos;@@ d come round me and that made me a lot ha@@ p@@ pi@@ er and gave me great comfor@@ t . &quot;
E@@ vi@@ e said she shared a special bond with her pet , which gave her tremendous support when she lost her ha@@ ir while endu@@ ring the gru@@ el@@ ling treatment .
&quot; it was very up@@ setting for me because I had long bro@@ wn ha@@ ir .
but at the same time as it was spring , gen@@ i@@ e was m@@ oul@@ ting as well so it was sort of like I &apos;@@ m losing my ha@@ ir and gen@@ i@@ e &apos;s losing her ha@@ ir as well so that e@@ ased the shock of it all . &quot;
E@@ vi@@ e &apos;s father , Ch@@ ris H@@ end@@ er@@ son , said the c@@ at had been a &quot; great dis@@ tra@@ ction &quot; and described how E@@ vi@@ e would watch video foo@@ tage of her bel@@ o@@ ved pet from her hospital bed .
&quot; E@@ vi@@ e was in hospital for over 300 days so we spent a lot of time in hospital and it just gave her something to look forward to when she did have those few precious days at home . &quot;
the 1@@ 1-@@ year-old said : &quot; I missed her every day I was in hospital , and my family could tell she missed me .
she &apos;s my best friend and I honestly don &apos;t know what I would do without her . &quot;
business group urges c@@ abin@@ et to agree on Bre@@ x@@ it transition
one of the UK &apos;s biggest business lobby groups has urged the c@@ abin@@ et to stop &quot; dan@@ cing around the ed@@ ges &quot; of Bre@@ x@@ it .
the Institute of Direc@@ tors ( I@@ o@@ D ) called on the c@@ abin@@ et to come up with a &quot; transitional agreement &quot; to smooth the move to Bre@@ x@@ it .
it wants it to bridge the &quot; the Bre@@ x@@ it Ga@@ p &quot; between leaving the EU and setting up new trading arrangements .
it warned that without agreement , business faces &quot; short-term cha@@ otic cli@@ ff ed@@ ges . &quot;
the group criticised the c@@ abin@@ et for engaging in what it called &quot; a range of speculative arguments over transition . &quot;
in recent weeks c@@ abin@@ et members have given opposing views on how long a transition period would last and what it would involve .
the I@@ o@@ D report brid@@ ging the Bre@@ x@@ it Ga@@ p : options for Tran@@ si@@ tion said : &quot; instead of dan@@ cing around the ed@@ ges , this issue must become a policy discussion for the c@@ abin@@ et .
this could minimise the growing level of confusion and uncertainty in this area . &quot;
however , Ger@@ ard Ly@@ ons , an econom@@ ist and leading figure in the econom@@ ists for Bre@@ x@@ it group this week described concern about a &quot; cli@@ ff@@ -@@ edge &quot; Bre@@ x@@ it as &quot; alar@@ mist talk &quot; similar to the fear of the Y@@ 2@@ K bu@@ g threat to compu@@ ters at the turn of the mil@@ lennium .
Chancellor of the Ex@@ che@@ qu@@ er Phili@@ p Ham@@ mon@@ d warned in June : &quot; there is a large amount of business investment that is being postponed until business can see more clearly what the likely outcome of these discussions is . &quot;
Al@@ li@@ e Ren@@ ison , I@@ o@@ D head of EU and Trade Policy , said : &quot; the Chancellor is right to worry about business investment stal@@ ling .
this is among the most frequently considered changes to deal with Bre@@ x@@ it , alongside relocation of operations to the EU .
the latter is especially true for I@@ o@@ D members in Northern Ireland who are currently considering co-@@ location or relocation . &quot;
the I@@ o@@ D suggests a range of options including : doing a deal to extend the Article 50 deal beyond March 201@@ 9
joining the European Economic Area
agreeing to stay longer under the rule of of EU law
creating a transitional customs agreement , similar to the EU Customs Union
Ms Ren@@ ison said : &quot; the I@@ o@@ D has put forward this range of options for transition in the hopes that it spar@@ ks a proper debate on the practic@@ alities of how best to Bre@@ x@@ it .
priorit@@ ising interim arrangements and thereby miti@@ gating the risks of EU exit means the even@@ tual opportunities are@@ n &apos;t dimin@@ ished by short-term cha@@ otic cli@@ ff ed@@ ges . &quot;
A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an codes are at the cross@@ roads
professional sport in Australia is at the cross@@ roads : some have travelled so far down the corporate path , they are too busines@@ s-@@ oriented to be called a sport .
others are re@@ treating back along the ama@@ te@@ ur path , too inher@@ ently spor@@ t-@@ minded to be considered a business .
the tortured delay in C@@ ric@@ ket Australia reaching a pay deal with its players ; the in@@ decision of the Australia Ru@@ g@@ by Union in sa@@ cking a team ; the revol@@ t by stakeholders of F@@ oo@@ t@@ ball Federation Australia ; ru@@ g@@ by lea@@ gue &apos;s problems in achieving a functioning independent commission and the A@@ F@@ L &apos;s rel@@ en@@ tless push to be stand@@ ar@@ d-@@ be@@ are@@ rs of social equity in the nation are evidence of this confusion .
John W@@ y@@ lie , an investment ban@@ ker and chair of the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an S@@ ports Commission , has been active in taking the Olympic sports down the same route as the professional codes , instal@@ ling business@@ men with no elite experience in a sport as chairs .
mining gi@@ ant Ri@@ o tin@@ to , with its reputation for uni@@ on-@@ bus@@ ting tac@@ tics , was seen as the og@@ re in C@@ A &apos;s problems in reaching an agreement with the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an cri@@ cke@@ ters Association .
ca chair David Pe@@ ever is a former managing director of Ri@@ o tin@@ to Australia and recru@@ ited a Ri@@ o tin@@ to executive and an advi@@ ser to assist C@@ A on the pay negotiations .
however , it would be a mistake to assume elite business@@ men who take a ru@@ th@@ less approach to dealing with cri@@ cke@@ ters don &apos;t love sport .
Pe@@ ever , for example , was a frequent atten@@ de@@ e at S@@ tor@@ m home games until he moved inter-@@ state .
nevertheless , the brutal negotiations between C@@ A and the AC@@ A and the stra@@ to@@ sp@@ heri@@ c salaries paid has produced the perception that Australia &apos;s fav@@ ou@@ rite summer pas@@ time is now more of a business than a sport .
by contrast , the ine@@ pt leadership of the AR@@ U by former NA@@ B chief executive Cameron C@@ ly@@ ne , in failing to cul@@ l an A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an Su@@ per Ru@@ g@@ by team , has pushed the code back to its roots .
ru@@ g@@ by union people now prefer to stro@@ ll down to a sub@@ urban o@@ val to watch a game between ama@@ te@@ ur teams , while si@@ pping on a be@@ er and eating a hot do@@ g .
ru@@ g@@ by union bo@@ asts it has the most corpor@@ ately qualified and diverse board in Australia , yet the failure of the code , when challenged by the demands of its international partners , ex@@ poses it as still too much of a sport to be a business .
both ru@@ g@@ by lea@@ gue and so@@ c@@ cer face problems over governance , with demands from stakeholders for more power .
the heads of both codes , the AR@@ L@@ C &apos;s John G@@ rant and F@@ F@@ A &apos;s Ste@@ ven L@@ ow@@ y , have demonstrated that their business skills have not been enough to achieve corporate stability .
grant , a former K@@ an@@ ga@@ ro@@ o , led a successful IT company but was effectively absent from the game for 20 years .
this became an asset when the newly formed AR@@ L@@ C needed an independent chair .
the code &apos;s stakeholders , none of whom tr@@ usted each other , decided that no one could sit on the commission if he / she had been involved with ru@@ g@@ by lea@@ gue in any way in the previous three years , apart from being a passive fan .
the p@@ endu@@ lu@@ m sw@@ ung too far to business and the f@@ ans of the code have been seeking a sa@@ vi@@ our , one with a celebrated past in the sport , since .
L@@ ow@@ y , the chief executive of West@@ field &apos;s overseas investments , in@@ heri@@ ted the F@@ F@@ A &apos;s chairman &apos;s role from his father , Fran@@ k , one of Australia &apos;s rich@@ est individuals .
the A@@ -@@ League club@@ s want greater representation on the con@@ g@@ ress that elec@@ ts the board .
their owners are losing money but believe they have the gra@@ vita@@ s of a Man@@ ch@@ ester United .
iron@@ ically , that great bas@@ tion of sport / business ethics , F@@ IF@@ A , is sending out emis@@ s@@ aries to end the sport &apos;s civil war .
the A@@ F@@ L has its own links to Ri@@ o tin@@ to via recently reti@@ red chairman M@@ ike F@@ it@@ z@@ pat@@ ric@@ k and former A@@ F@@ L commissioner Ch@@ ris L@@ y@@ n@@ ch , the mining gi@@ ant &apos;s C@@ F@@ O .
the code bo@@ asts a national leadership role in promoting gender equity , In@@ dig@@ en@@ ous and refugee causes and gay rights .
a cy@@ nic might suggest this is done with an eye on government grants .
the A@@ F@@ L chairman , Richard Go@@ y@@ der , said , when replacing F@@ it@@ z@@ pat@@ ric@@ k , &quot; The A@@ F@@ L is more than a business because of the way that it reaches into all these communities . &quot;
Go@@ y@@ der is the out@@ going chief executive of W@@ es@@ farmers and the first chair of the A@@ F@@ L who has not played the game at the elite level .
a former W@@ es@@ farmers chairman , Bo@@ b E@@ very , si@@ ts on the board of C@@ ric@@ ket Australia .
the common threa@@ d in many of the appointments to the boards of professional sports is the promotion of independence over competence .
in the rush to recru@@ it top business people , they have neglected what might be called the aff@@ ec@@ tion and aff@@ in@@ ity for a sport .
furthermore , many of the corporate heav@@ y@@ we@@ ights are not ac@@ custom@@ ed to the intense - sometimes personal - scrutiny from the media .
what might work in the corporate world do@@ es@@ n &apos;t necessarily translate to the world of sport .
Jordan court up@@ holds life sentence for killing of 3 U@@ .@@ S@@ . troops
a military appeals court in Jordan has upheld the life sentence of a J@@ or@@ dan@@ ian sol@@ di@@ er in the shoo@@ ting deaths of three U@@ .@@ S@@ . military tra@@ in@@ ers last year .
first S@@ g@@ t@@ . Mar@@ ik al-@@ Tu@@ wa@@ y@@ h@@ a , was sentenced by a military court last month to life in prison with hard lab@@ or for killing the Americans at the entr@@ ance to an air base in southern Jordan .
Al@@ -@@ Tu@@ wa@@ y@@ h@@ a had opened fire at a U@@ .@@ S@@ . con@@ vo@@ y , claiming he fea@@ red the base was coming under attack .
however , security cam@@ era video released after the verdict showed that he kept fir@@ ing as two of the Americans took cover and wa@@ ved their arms , in an apparent effort to stop the shoo@@ ting .
the news website H@@ al@@ a A@@ k@@ h@@ ba@@ r , linked to the J@@ or@@ dan@@ ian military , reported on Thursday that a fi@@ ve-@@ judge military appeals court upheld al-@@ Tu@@ wa@@ y@@ h@@ a &apos;s sentence .
Sy@@ l@@ ves@@ ter Sta@@ l@@ l@@ one to gu@@ est sta@@ r in &apos; This Is us &apos; season 2
Sy@@ l@@ ves@@ ter Sta@@ l@@ l@@ one is going to visit N@@ B@@ C &apos;s hit dram@@ a in its upcoming second season , executive producer D@@ an F@@ og@@ el@@ man announced Thursday during a pan@@ el for the series at the Tele@@ vision critics Association press t@@ our .
the actor is going to gu@@ est as K@@ e@@ v@@ in &apos;s ( J@@ us@@ ti@@ n Har@@ tle@@ y ) co-@@ sta@@ r in the mo@@ vi@@ e he &apos;s f@@ il@@ m@@ ing at the start of the season .
&quot; K@@ e@@ v@@ in is shoo@@ ting a big mo@@ vi@@ e and we needed a big co-@@ sta@@ r , &quot; F@@ og@@ el@@ man said .
at the end of last season , K@@ e@@ v@@ in s@@ co@@ red a big acting job in a film directed by R@@ on Ho@@ ward , who had a c@@ am@@ e@@ o in the show .
this season will see the character in production on the project and also working to rebuild his relationship with his ex , played by ac@@ t@@ ress Alex@@ and@@ ra B@@ rec@@ k@@ enri@@ dge .

F@@ og@@ el@@ man said V@@ enti@@ mig@@ lia &apos;s continued friendship with Sta@@ l@@ l@@ one likely helped the show score the b@@ ig@@ -@@ name gu@@ est sta@@ r .

J@@ am@@ es Har@@ ris@@ on sp@@ ends roughly $ 3@@ 00@@ ,@@ 000 a Year to K@@ ee@@ p Bo@@ dy in playing shape
any N@@ F@@ L player reli@@ es on his body to make a living .
many more a@@ th@@ le@@ tes thus invest heavily on condi@@ tioning and recovery to stay in pea@@ k shape .
ES@@ P@@ N@@ .@@ com &apos;s Je@@ re@@ my F@@ ow@@ ler profi@@ led the deep len@@ g@@ ths some ve@@ ter@@ ans take to pro@@ long their careers .
no case is more extreme than J@@ am@@ es Har@@ ris@@ on , the 3@@ 9@@ -@@ year-old Pittsburgh S@@ tee@@ lers l@@ ine@@ bac@@ ker preparing for his 14@@ th season .
according to F@@ ow@@ ler , Har@@ ris@@ on sp@@ ends around $ 3@@ 00@@ ,@@ 000 a year on ac@@ u@@ pun@@ c@@ ture , mas@@ sa@@ ge ther@@ ap@@ y , chi@@ ro@@ prac@@ tors and cu@@ pping .
most of the cost stems from travel@@ ing across the country to see specialists .
&quot; I don &apos;t need to do the checks and balances like that , &quot; Har@@ ris@@ on said .
&quot; when it comes down to it , what I make ver@@ sus what I spend , the pay@@ out is worth it based on how I feel . &quot;
safety M@@ ike Mitchell , Har@@ ris@@ on &apos;s S@@ tee@@ lers te@@ am@@ mate and training partner , estimated a $ 200@@ ,@@ 000 annual bill on his body maintenance expenses .
the 3@@ 0-@@ year-old has tested body temper@@ ing , which F@@ ow@@ ler described as &quot; basically fo@@ am rolling with about 120 p@@ ounds of me@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; instead of rolling on it , it rol@@ ls on you , &quot; Mitchell said .
&quot; if you had any kno@@ ts in your le@@ g and they start moving that thing around , it gets painful at times .
but when you stand up , you &apos;@@ re loo@@ se immediately .
it just s@@ mas@@ hes the tension out . &quot;
while those go the extra mi@@ le , reti@@ red N@@ F@@ L players Bar@@ ry Co@@ field and R@@ yan Har@@ ris la@@ be@@ led $ 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 a fair average on ye@@ arly recovery costs .
Co@@ field , who played for 10 se@@ as@@ ons with the New York gi@@ ants and Washington re@@ d@@ s@@ kin@@ s , expressed regret over not spending more .
&quot; if I were to go back , I would invest even more , &quot; Co@@ field told F@@ ow@@ ler .
&quot; I &apos;@@ d probably spend twice as much .
I was very healthy the first eight years of my career .
toward the end , maybe more treat@@ ments would have helped . &quot;
R@@ yan S@@ haz@@ i@@ er , a 2@@ 4-@@ year-old l@@ ine@@ bac@@ ker , expressed a willingness to follow the lead of his ve@@ te@@ ra@@ n S@@ tee@@ lers te@@ am@@ mates .
&quot; if you pay $ 10@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 and you make an extra $ 3 million playing , that &apos;s an easy decision , &quot; S@@ haz@@ i@@ er said .
in terms of career lon@@ ge@@ vity , investing on player recovery is far smar@@ ter than spending on cars and man@@ sions .
the average N@@ F@@ L player is lu@@ cky to play beyond 30 , so Har@@ ris@@ on &apos;s success should especially persuade pe@@ ers to re@@ direct their ear@@ nings .
but maybe they can just find local specialists .
how P@@ rin@@ ces@@ s Di@@ ana used her ma@@ ke@@ -up as a weapon
when I think about P@@ rin@@ ces@@ s Di@@ ana &apos;s ma@@ ke@@ -up , the first thing that comes to mind is the ey@@ el@@ in@@ er .
to begin with , the gir@@ lish blue of her youth .
later , the heavy black K@@ oh@@ l of her Martin B@@ ash@@ ir Pan@@ or@@ am@@ a inter@@ view , deployed to devastating effect as she ga@@ zed up through th@@ ick las@@ hes and u@@ tte@@ red the im@@ mor@@ tal line : &quot; there were three of us in this marriage , so it was a bit crow@@ ded . &quot;
her eyes , huge and mo@@ ist and outlined heavily in black against her Ga@@ unt , pal@@ e face , gave her the appearance of a w@@ ounded animal .
it was exactly the effect she wanted to achieve .
in private , though , P@@ rin@@ ces@@ s Di@@ ana never wor@@ e much ma@@ ke@@ -up : not by modern standards anyway .
it was@@ n &apos;t just that she di@@ d@@ n &apos;t need to - she was a genuine beau@@ ty - it was also that she saw it as a bit of a ch@@ ore ; work@@ -related rather than a source of pleasure .
in public , she could be th@@ ic@@ kly pain@@ ted .
she once arrived at the offices of Con@@ de n@@ ast , publis@@ hers of vo@@ gue , we@@ aring a heavy la@@ yer of almost or@@ an@@ ge foundation .
she a@@ po@@ log@@ ised , saying that if she di@@ d@@ n &apos;t make sure her sk@@ in had the requ@@ isite sun@@ -@@ k@@ is@@ sed g@@ low and went out looking &quot; normal , &quot; the Pa@@ par@@ az@@ z@@ i would take pic@@ tures and everyone would acc@@ use her of looking &quot; pal@@ e , &quot; &quot; w@@ an &quot; and &quot; exha@@ usted . &quot;
it was for this reason Di@@ ana had thri@@ ce-@@ wee@@ kly sun@@ bed sessions , on a machine she kept at home .
today , of course , such behaviour would be f@@ ro@@ w@@ ned upon for health reasons , but for Di@@ ana they served a useful purpose - allowing her to present a sun@@ n@@ y dis@@ position to the world even when on the inside all was dark cl@@ ou@@ ds and th@@ under .
perhaps one of the biggest mistakes the Ro@@ y@@ al Fam@@ ily ever made was in thinking that , by approving her as a wife for Char@@ les , they were getting themselves a pretty little bro@@ o@@ d m@@ are with nothing but flu@@ ff for bra@@ ins .
the exact opposite was true .
she may not have been top of the class at school , but when it came to image management , she was an A@@ -@@ sta@@ r pu@@ pi@@ l .
to Di@@ ana , ha@@ ir and ma@@ ke@@ -up were important insofar as they could be used to communicate a m@@ ood or a feeling .
otherwise , she had not the slightest bit of interest .
her friend R@@ os@@ a Mon@@ ck@@ ton - Di@@ ana was go@@ d@@ mother to her youn@@ gest child - re@@ members that ma@@ ke@@ -up was not something they ever talked about .
&quot; what I do remember , &quot; she says , &quot; is how reli@@ e@@ ved she was on the times we went on holiday together that she di@@ d@@ n &apos;t have to put it on . &quot;
now , we tend to think of ma@@ ke@@ -up as a way of enhancing a woman &apos;s looks , but if you look back across the ar@@ c of Di@@ ana &apos;s life , it &apos;s clear she used it as a powerful P@@ R tool .
those moments when she was most at ease , most herself , are the ones where she is also at her most natural , we@@ aring hardly any ma@@ ke@@ -up at all .
C@@ are@@ ering down lo@@ gg@@ ers leap at T@@ hor@@ pe Par@@ k in 1993 with her two young s@@ ons , she is d@@ ren@@ ched to the sk@@ in and laugh@@ ing like a drain , her mas@@ car@@ a pool@@ ing under@@ ne@@ ath her eyes like any other mother on a day out with the k@@ ids .
four months since her separation from Char@@ les was announced , at last she looks de@@ fi@@ antly care@@ free and &quot; normal . &quot;
or zi@@ pping out of the gy@@ m in those later years , ha@@ ir s@@ lic@@ ked back , ton@@ ed leg@@ s en@@ ca@@ sed in cy@@ c@@ ling shor@@ ts , face f@@ lus@@ hed from her work@@ out , health and vita@@ lity oo@@ zing from every por@@ e .
towards the end of her life , when she was beginning to assert her independence and as her confidence gre@@ w , we saw more and more of this Di@@ ana .
she became involved with the H@@ AL@@ O T@@ r@@ ust , fam@@ ously wal@@ king through a min@@ e@@ field in Ang@@ ol@@ a in January 1997 .
then 35 , her ha@@ ir soft and natural , her face almost entirely free of ma@@ ke@@ -up , she had ar@@ gu@@ ably never looked more beautiful , or more re@@ minis@@ cent of the b@@ right , hopeful young gir@@ l s@@ mil@@ ing out of her engagement pho@@ to 15 years earlier .
Di@@ ana was just coming into her prime .
in the early days there was a dre@@ am@@ y , P@@ re-@@ Rap@@ ha@@ elite quality to the young Di@@ ana S@@ pen@@ cer .
but it was@@ n &apos;t long before the &quot; prin@@ ces@@ si@@ fication &quot; began - a process largely or@@ ch@@ es@@ tra@@ ted by the P@@ ress and Pal@@ ace to turn Di@@ ana into a s@@ oph@@ isti@@ cated young la@@ dy worthy of her new status .
in part , this involved the handi@@ work of C@@ la@@ y@@ ton Ho@@ ward , the ve@@ te@@ ra@@ n ma@@ ke@@ -up ar@@ tist L@@ ord S@@ no@@ w@@ don often used for photo@@ shoo@@ ts .
Ho@@ ward first met a ner@@ v@@ ous Di@@ ana at S@@ no@@ w@@ don &apos;s Ken@@ sing@@ ton to@@ w@@ n@@ house for the vo@@ gue ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine shoo@@ t that would produce the official engagement picture .
at this point , in late 19@@ 80 , Di@@ ana was a blan@@ k can@@ va@@ s .
her most s@@ oph@@ isti@@ cated beau@@ ty products came from The Bo@@ dy S@@ ho@@ p - El@@ der@@ f@@ lower Un@@ der E@@ y@@ e G@@ el , for example .
Ho@@ ward used Ma@@ x F@@ actor she@@ er gen@@ i@@ us foundation in H@@ one@@ y touch and a Ma@@ x F@@ actor b@@ lus@@ her stick in f@@ ro@@ sted cor@@ al .
on the e@@ ye@@ li@@ ds , he applied Eli@@ z@@ a@@ be@@ th Ar@@ den sha@@ des R@@ ice and Tim@@ ber@@ land , with a white f@@ ro@@ sted ey@@ es@@ ha@@ do@@ w on the b@@ row .
na@@ vy Eli@@ z@@ a@@ be@@ th Ar@@ den mas@@ car@@ a and that blue ey@@ el@@ in@@ er , also Ar@@ den , completed the look .
and we know all this because Ho@@ ward created a bes@@ po@@ ke face char@@ t for her .
&quot; Di@@ ana &apos;s eyes are so specta@@ cular in colour that I wanted to emphasise their striking blu@@ en@@ ess , &quot; he later wrote .
the finished result is not fla@@ t@@ tering to such a young gir@@ l : she looks 18 going on 50 .
her bro@@ ws are too heavy , and her eyes over@@ worked in du@@ ll bro@@ wn .
most striking , though , is the inf@@ am@@ ous ey@@ el@@ in@@ er - wor@@ n on the water@@ line , inside the eye - in that gh@@ as@@ tly Dis@@ ne@@ y P@@ rin@@ ces@@ s blue .
a fan@@ tas@@ y sha@@ de for a fan@@ tas@@ y bri@@ de .
no wonder Di@@ ana looks back at us a little un@@ sure .
one of the sources of Di@@ ana &apos;s an@@ gu@@ ish was that she never knew where her public person@@ a stopped and her private self began .
this was the start of it .
the person who perhaps had the most influence on Di@@ ana &apos;s look was M@@ ary Gre@@ en@@ well , still very much a part of the modern ma@@ ke@@ -up scene .
now an amb@@ assador for , among others , Chan@@ el , she remains one of the i@@ con@@ s of the ma@@ ke@@ -up world .
&quot; Di@@ ana had the most amaz@@ ing , beautiful sk@@ in and long li@@ mb@@ s , &quot; she re@@ members today .
&quot; she was simply g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous .
men ad@@ o@@ red her .
she was sex@@ y without meaning to be . &quot;
M@@ ary first met Di@@ ana in 199@@ 1 , when she was asked by Anna Har@@ ve@@ y - then head st@@ y@@ list at vo@@ gue - to do her ma@@ ke@@ -up for a shoo@@ t with Pat@@ ric@@ k D@@ em@@ ar@@ che@@ li@@ er , one of the ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine &apos;s most celebrated photo@@ graph@@ ers , for the December issue .
ha@@ ir@@ d@@ res@@ ser S@@ am Mc@@ K@@ night was also part of the team .
this was at the he@@ ight of Di@@ ana and Char@@ les &apos;s marriage w@@ o@@ es and the beginning of the s@@ k@@ ir@@ mis@@ h for public support .
&quot; they di@@ d@@ n &apos;t tell us who it was , although we knew it was someone very famous , &quot; says Gre@@ en@@ well .
&quot; when we arrived , Di@@ ana was just standing there looking g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous , swe@@ et and friendly , and so ex@@ cited to be on the cover of vo@@ gue . &quot;
the resulting cover - Di@@ ana in a simple black s@@ we@@ a@@ ter , ch@@ in rest@@ ing on her hands , her blue eyes b@@ right , e@@ leg@@ ant French po@@ lish on her na@@ ils , ha@@ ir cro@@ pped short - was a gam@@ e-@@ chan@@ ger .
it radi@@ ated posi@@ tivity , indi@@ vi@@ du@@ ality and fla@@ ir .
it was , above all , modern - en@@ cap@@ su@@ lating the ne@@ at , pare@@ d-@@ back a@@ es@@ thetic of the early n@@ ine@@ ties and placing Di@@ ana in star@@ k contrast to the Ro@@ y@@ al Fam@@ ily , which was about to embark on what the Qu@@ e@@ en would later call her &quot; An@@ n@@ us horri@@ bi@@ lis . &quot;
&quot; Di@@ ana was very rela@@ xed about her ma@@ ke@@ -up .
she really just wanted to look fresh and new , &quot; says Gre@@ en@@ well .
over time she taught Di@@ ana to do her own ma@@ ke@@ -up - Mo@@ is@@ tu@@ ri@@ ser , foundation , conce@@ al@@ er to lift the eyes , mas@@ car@@ a - and emphasised a healthy sk@@ inc@@ are regime , encouraging her to take good care of herself and adopt a &quot; beau@@ ty from within &quot; man@@ tra .
Di@@ ana &quot; did everything in moder@@ ation , &quot; says Gre@@ en@@ well .
she got plenty of s@@ lee@@ p and cut back on alcohol , essential for f@@ res@@ h@@ -@@ looking sk@@ in .
the P@@ rin@@ ces@@ s favoured Gu@@ er@@ la@@ in foundation , C@@ lar@@ ins li@@ ps@@ tic@@ ks and Wil@@ d Ro@@ se b@@ lus@@ her by Clin@@ ique .
but the biggest favour M@@ ary did for Di@@ ana was to we@@ an her off blue ey@@ el@@ in@@ er .
&quot; it was just so very ageing for her , &quot; she says .
instead , she used a combination of soft B@@ R@@ O@@ W@@ N@@ S and neutral ton@@ es , with a bro@@ wn pen@@ cil along the las@@ h line , b@@ len@@ ded so that all the ed@@ ges were beau@@ ti@@ fully sof@@ tened .
often she just used a tin@@ ted Mo@@ is@@ tu@@ ri@@ ser and a little bit of b@@ ron@@ z@@ er to emphasise Di@@ ana &apos;s healthy g@@ low .
&quot; Di@@ ana used to ring me and ask me to go over to discuss products with her , which I lo@@ ved to do , &quot; Gre@@ en@@ well tells me .
&quot; I think she found it rela@@ xing ; her chance to have a few moments to herself . &quot;
luxury br@@ and C@@ lar@@ ins was a fav@@ ou@@ rite .
Di@@ ana was said to have used their Sen@@ si@@ tive sk@@ in day and night cre@@ ams and their Al@@ p@@ ine her@@ bs clean@@ ser and ton@@ er .
she also had regular fa@@ ci@@ als at the Central London Sal@@ on of beau@@ ty ther@@ ap@@ ist Jan@@ et F@@ il@@ der@@ man .
Di@@ ana had fam@@ ously lo@@ vely sk@@ in , but sometimes suffered from ro@@ sa@@ ce@@ a , a mil@@ d che@@ ek ras@@ h that is often st@@ res@@ s-@@ related .
to calm it , she used a combination of natural s@@ oo@@ thing o@@ ils , including ro@@ se-@@ hi@@ p .
&quot; the thing about Di@@ ana , &quot; says Gre@@ en@@ well , &quot; is that she had the most wonderful b@@ one structure . &quot;
the only part of her appearance she was not wholly confident about was her no@@ se .
as Anna Har@@ ve@@ y rec@@ alls : &quot; once , when the papers were saying she &apos;@@ d had her no@@ se done , she turned to me and said laugh@@ ingly : &apos; honestly , if I &apos;@@ d had my no@@ se done , do you think I would have chosen this one ? &apos; &quot;
as the advice from M@@ ary Gre@@ en@@ well and S@@ am Mc@@ K@@ night took hold , Di@@ ana began to grow more confident in her new look .
one of her most memor@@ able appe@@ aran@@ ces - at the Ser@@ pen@@ tine G@@ alle@@ ry in London in 1994 we@@ aring the famous &quot; reven@@ ge d@@ ress , &quot; a d@@ aring off-@@ the-@@ shoulder , f@@ ig@@ u@@ re-@@ hu@@ gging number by Chris@@ tina Sta@@ mb@@ oli@@ an - shows her starting to c@@ ry@@ stal@@ l@@ ise what was to become her signature style in the final years of her life .
ha@@ ir short and swe@@ pt back , up and over the e@@ ars , Di@@ ana is both sex@@ y and dynamic , her no-@@ nonsense crop a sharp contrast to the very d@@ aring black Sil@@ k d@@ ress .
her ma@@ ke@@ -up is perfect : fla@@ t@@ tering yet under@@ stated , the blue of her eyes emphasised by the black on her water@@ line .
never one to sh@@ y from b@@ right col@@ ours - particularly re@@ ds - she we@@ ars the high glo@@ ss s@@ car@@ let na@@ il po@@ lish , almost certainly Re@@ v@@ l@@ on Red , that now becomes a kind of trade@@ mark .
a few months later , she f@@ las@@ hed her e@@ leg@@ ant red man@@ ic@@ ure launching the Chil@@ d be@@ rea@@ vement T@@ r@@ ust at the Ro@@ y@@ al College of nur@@ sing .
the P@@ rin@@ ces@@ s is the picture of health and self-@@ confidence .
she is also completely and finally in control .
tan@@ ned and ton@@ ed , her ma@@ ke@@ -up fla@@ w@@ less , she projects exactly what she wants the vi@@ e@@ wer to think : here is a woman who , at last , seems to have both a sense of self and purpose in life , and who , having just turned 36 , is at last coming into her own .
it &apos;s just a shame that she never got to prove herself right .

tru@@ mp trans@@ cri@@ pt lea@@ k likely a federal crime , former prosecu@@ tors say
whoever le@@ ak@@ ed the trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts of President tru@@ mp &apos;s phone calls with foreign leaders to the press likely committed a crime , former prosecu@@ tors said Thursday - as law@@ makers called for ro@@ ot@@ ing out the cul@@ pri@@ t .
&quot; the un@@ author@@ iz@@ ed release of these documents to the press is a crime , &quot; Jo@@ e di@@ G@@ en@@ o@@ va , the former U@@ .@@ S@@ . at@@ tor@@ ne@@ y for the D@@ is@@ tri@@ ct of C@@ olu@@ m@@ bia , told Fo@@ x Ne@@ ws .
the series of acts involving release of notes of the president &apos;s conver@@ sa@@ tions with foreign leaders , and these trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts , are a serious threat to national security .
based on the le@@ ak@@ ed documents , The Washington Po@@ st reported new details Thursday about tru@@ mp &apos;s ten@@ se phone calls in late January with Mexic@@ an President En@@ ri@@ que Pe@@ ñ@@ a N@@ ie@@ to and A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Tur@@ n@@ bul@@ l .
in the former , tru@@ mp re@@ por@@ te@@ dly told the Mexic@@ an leader to stop publicly saying his government would not pay for a border wall .
the newspaper said the trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts had notes indicating they had been classified by the chief of staff on the National Security Council .
the Po@@ st said it obtained full trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts , which were &quot; produced by White House staff &quot; and based on records kept by White House no@@ te-@@ tak@@ ers .
&quot; there is a federal statute that makes it a crime , a federal crime , to dissemin@@ ate classified information to an un@@ author@@ iz@@ ed person , &quot; D@@ ou@@ g Bur@@ ns , a former federal prosecu@@ tor in New York , said in a phone inter@@ view .
while some details of those calls already had emerged in February , the release of the trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts marks a much bigger blow to a White House trying to cra@@ ck down on le@@ aks .
the report incidentally was published as top figures in the tru@@ mp administration are preparing to go before the public on Friday in a show of force to demonstrate their commitment to ro@@ ot@@ ing out le@@ ak@@ ers of classified information .
At@@ tor@@ ne@@ y General J@@ ef@@ f sessions , Director of National In@@ tel@@ ligence D@@ an co@@ ats , De@@ puty At@@ tor@@ ne@@ y General ro@@ d Ro@@ sen@@ stein and National Coun@@ ter@@ intelligence and Security C@@ en@@ ter Director Wil@@ li@@ am E@@ van@@ ina are all expected to brief the public at Justice De@@ part@@ ment headquarters .
it &apos;s unclear whether the Po@@ st lea@@ k might be investigated by the D@@ O@@ J .
to prosecu@@ te someone for this , Bur@@ ns said there are &quot; certain elements that obviously have to be shown . &quot;
he said &quot; there can be d@@ us@@ t-@@ u@@ ps over that , &quot; c@@ iting the investigation into former Secretary of State H@@ ill@@ ary Clin@@ ton &apos;s ema@@ ils and the decision not to prosecu@@ te .
those considerations include the mark@@ ings and history of the document and its exact classification .
if classified , prosecu@@ tors would look to see if it was dissemin@@ ated to an un@@ author@@ iz@@ ed person in a manner that nega@@ tively affects the interests of the United States .
&quot; if all of those things can be proven , people can very definitely be in harm &apos;s way for criminal exposure , &quot; Bur@@ ns said .
&quot; no question . &quot;
speaking of the trans@@ cri@@ p@@ ts of tru@@ mp &apos;s phone calls , di@@ G@@ en@@ o@@ va , who prosecuted es@@ pi@@ on@@ age cases , said these documents are &quot; generally classified at secret and above . &quot;
claiming the le@@ aks imperi@@ l the ability of the U@@ .@@ S@@ . government to conduct foreign policy , di@@ G@@ en@@ o@@ va called on the at@@ tor@@ ne@@ y general to institu@@ te a federal criminal g@@ rand ju@@ ry to find the le@@ ak@@ ers .
he also said the phone records of the re@@ por@@ ters and ed@@ it@@ ors of The Washington Po@@ st should be sub@@ po@@ en@@ a@@ ed , something the journalists would surely protest .
on Cap@@ it@@ ol H@@ ill , U@@ ta@@ h Re@@ publi@@ can Sen@@ . M@@ ike Le@@ e said Thursday there should be criminal prosecution for lea@@ king classified information .
&quot; whoever le@@ ak@@ ed these needs to be found out and needs to be re@@ pri@@ man@@ ded , needs to be fired , &quot; Le@@ e told Fo@@ x Ne@@ ws &apos; &quot; America &apos;s Ne@@ ws H@@ Q . &quot;
&quot; this is unacceptable and should never happen . &quot;
Le@@ e , who practic@@ ed law before being elected to the Senate in 2010 , said such a lea@@ k &quot; is a fel@@ ony , a very serious federal fel@@ ony off@@ en@@ se . &quot;
&quot; doing something like this could not only and should not only result in ter@@ mination but also criminal prosecution to the extent there &apos;s classified information involved , &quot; he said .
Friday &apos;s announcement at the De@@ part@@ ment of Justice may provide more of an overview of what the D@@ O@@ J hopes to accomp@@ lish rather than specific prosecu@@ tions at this stage , Fo@@ x Ne@@ ws is told .
last week , the president , las@@ hing out against in his at@@ tor@@ ne@@ y general in public , critici@@ zed sessions for not doing enough to find the le@@ ak@@ ers .
&quot; I want the at@@ tor@@ ne@@ y general to be much tougher on the le@@ aks from intelligence agencies , &quot; tru@@ mp said in the Ro@@ se Gar@@ den on July 25 .
sessions himself , speaking to Fo@@ x Ne@@ ws &apos; Tu@@ c@@ ker Car@@ l@@ son last week , admitted he has not been satisfied with the efforts to investigate le@@ aks , which have repeatedly ham@@ pered the president since his in@@ augu@@ ration .
&quot; I have not been happy with the past prosecu@@ tions and investigations of criminal le@@ aks , &quot; sessions said .
even some critics of the president have spoken out against the le@@ aks , saying such efforts harm foreign policy efforts .
&quot; lea@@ king the trans@@ cri@@ pt of a presidential call to a foreign leader is unprecedented , shocking , and dangerous , &quot; David F@@ ru@@ m wrote in the Atlantic on Thursday .
&quot; it is vitally important that a president be able to speak confidenti@@ ally - and perhaps even more important that foreign leaders understand that they can reply in confidence . &quot;
Sen@@ . Mar@@ k War@@ ner , D@@ -@@ V@@ a . , top Democra@@ t on the Senate In@@ tel@@ ligence Committee , also told The Da@@ ily Be@@ ast the lea@@ k is &quot; absolutely &quot; trou@@ b@@ ling and should be investigated by Congress .
us Na@@ vy ve@@ te@@ ra@@ n ordered to remove American flag w@@ ra@@ p from ma@@ il@@ box
a ma@@ il@@ box covered with the American flag is at the C@@ en@@ ter of a dispute bre@@ wing between a reti@@ red U@@ .@@ S@@ . ve@@ te@@ ra@@ n and a home@@ owners association in F@@ l@@ ori@@ da .
reti@@ red U@@ .@@ S@@ . Na@@ vy O@@ ff@@ ic@@ er John A@@ ck@@ ert says he received a letter last week from the Sou@@ th@@ wood residential Community associ@@ ate in T@@ al@@ la@@ h@@ as@@ see that asked him to remove the w@@ rap@@ ping of O@@ l@@ d gl@@ ory around the ma@@ il@@ box or face penalties .
he told W@@ C@@ TV he &apos;s not backing down without a fight and has made an appeal .
&quot; I view this as a form of bul@@ lying to be honest , &quot; A@@ ck@@ ert said .
and I think people should stand up to bul@@ lying of any form , and particularly this .
A@@ ck@@ ert said the H@@ .@@ O@@ .@@ A claimed his ma@@ il@@ box was not &quot; in con@@ s@@ on@@ ance &quot; with the a@@ es@@ thetic values of Sou@@ th@@ wood .
U@@ .@@ S@@ . Na@@ vy ve@@ te@@ ra@@ n John A@@ ck@@ ert said he &apos;s been ordered to take down the American flag w@@ ra@@ p covering his ma@@ il@@ box .
&quot; as the holiday season comes to a close , please remove the American flag ma@@ il@@ box w@@ ra@@ p , &quot; the letter read .
dec@@ oration may be displayed 30 days prior and must be taken down 15 days after .
he said the w@@ ra@@ p has been up for four years .
it was put there 30 days after I moved into this house .
messages to the Sou@@ th@@ wood residential Community Association were not immediately returned Thursday morning .
some of A@@ ck@@ ert &apos;s ne@@ igh@@ b@@ ors told W@@ C@@ TV the letter was a bit harsh and said they were not entirely surprised by the H@@ .@@ O@@ .@@ A &apos;s actions .
&quot; they do things like this all the time , &quot; M@@ ike Ste@@ ph@@ en@@ son said .
I think it &apos;s ridiculous .
what &apos;s wrong with being patri@@ otic in the country you live in ?
M@@ ike P@@ AT@@ EL said : &quot; the man &apos;s a ve@@ te@@ ra@@ n , he served the country .
it &apos;s just a ma@@ il@@ box with a flag .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s right .
he ow@@ ns the house , he can at least have that .
the H@@ .@@ O@@ .@@ A@@ . letter says A@@ ck@@ ert has 15 days to remove the w@@ ra@@ p or face a fine .
he has not received a response to his appeal .

&quot; Le@@ il@@ i me@@ ts@@ al@@ ood &quot; ( Le@@ il@@ i &apos;s forest ta@@ les ) &quot; blo@@ g Ar@@ ch@@ ive &quot; L@@ and and road improvement works
having once been in the profession myself , I inevitably take notice of any kind of land improvement work , whether taking place in the forest or fields .
the machinery and the quality of the work have improved significantly and now everything takes place with more energy than in the past .
land improvement features from the past are now primarily being reno@@ vated , f@@ laws and bloc@@ ka@@ ges are sought and fixed .
more stringent environmental requirements have come into effect , ones that were not given much attention decades ago .
the construction materials have been updated , now p@@ las@@ tic pi@@ pes are used in building cul@@ ver@@ ts instead of the reinforced concrete pi@@ pes of the past , and stones are comple@@ mented by textile - geo@@ textile as it is called - for reinforcing the sides of dit@@ ches .
in the past , ou@@ tle@@ ts and cul@@ ver@@ ts were reinforced with prec@@ ast concrete pan@@ els ( of the M@@ P or land improvement and the V@@ K@@ P or hy@@ d@@ ro construction variety ) and so@@ d .
for the purpose of environmental protection , before dra@@ in@@ age waters ( under@@ ground dra@@ ins , dit@@ ches ) reach natural stream@@ s and or rivers , se@@ dim@@ en@@ tation pon@@ ds are du@@ g for collec@@ tor dit@@ ches ; these pon@@ ds should help clean the water of any ferti@@ li@@ z@@ ers and toxic residu@@ es .
often cat@@ -@@ ta@@ ils are plan@@ ted on the bot@@ toms of the new set@@ tling pon@@ ds or bas@@ ins or they start to grow spon@@ tan@@ e@@ ously from air@@ borne se@@ ed .
C@@ atta@@ ils have the property of fil@@ tering toxic substances out of water .
the pon@@ d in the picture was du@@ g last year and this year the soil at one end of the pon@@ d was level@@ led off , and a well for ab@@ stra@@ ction of fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ting was established using concrete ring installations .
to keep an er@@ rant vehicle from speeding into the pon@@ d , some larger ch@@ un@@ ks of ro@@ ck were also transported to line the lot .
besides clean@@ ing dit@@ ches lining fields , the repair of forest roads is also under way .
the seg@@ ment of forest road pic@@ tured should be part of the municipal road , which is also getting an additional gra@@ vel surface .
to the right is state forest , where the road being reno@@ vated continues to the right in front of the du@@ mp tru@@ ck and which will soon be completed .
to the left is private forest .
the municipal road continues on and there the dit@@ ches along the fields and farming roads are being reno@@ vated and dra@@ in@@ age f@@ laws that have become evident are being fixed .
report : Mu@@ el@@ ler conven@@ es G@@ rand ju@@ ry in Russia In@@ ves@@ ti@@ gation
a g@@ rand ju@@ ry has been im@@ pan@@ e@@ led by the special coun@@ sel investigating possible links between Russia and Don@@ al@@ d tru@@ mp &apos;s presidential campaign , The Wall S@@ tre@@ et J@@ our@@ nal reported Thursday .
the paper reports that the g@@ rand ju@@ ry is a new and significant development in Special coun@@ sel Robert Mu@@ el@@ ler &apos;s pro@@ be into whether tru@@ mp or his top advi@@ sers col@@ lu@@ ded with Moscow to advance the Re@@ publi@@ can &apos;s presidential campaign in 201@@ 6 .
N@@ b@@ c Ne@@ ws has previously reported that before Mu@@ el@@ ler , the former F@@ B@@ I director now leading the pro@@ be , was appointed , federal prosecu@@ tors had conven@@ ed g@@ rand ju@@ ri@@ es as part of the investigations into former National Security Ad@@ vi@@ ser Michael F@@ ly@@ n@@ n and tru@@ mp &apos;s former campaign chairman Paul M@@ ana@@ for@@ t .
John D@@ ow@@ d , one of the president &apos;s private lawyers , told N@@ B@@ C Ne@@ ws he was not aware that Mu@@ el@@ ler had started using a g@@ rand ju@@ ry .
&quot; we have been cooperating with Bo@@ b Mu@@ el@@ ler and his staff since the first of June because we &apos;@@ re trying to get this thing over and done with , &quot; he said .
&quot; with respect to news of a federal g@@ rand ju@@ ry being im@@ pan@@ e@@ led , we have no reason to believe President tru@@ mp is under investigation . &quot;
N@@ b@@ c Ne@@ ws has not independently verified the J@@ our@@ nal report .
the use of a g@@ rand ju@@ ry is part of the normal process of a complex investigation and it is a tool not just for hearing testi@@ mon@@ y but for learning about and obtaining records from individuals or companies .
it is a powerful tool prosecu@@ tors can use to seek indic@@ t@@ ments and sub@@ po@@ en@@ as , and may be a signal Mu@@ el@@ ler &apos;s work is far from over .
tru@@ mp has denied that he or any members of his team col@@ lu@@ ding with Russia during the 201@@ 6 presidential campaign .
officials in Moscow have also denied playing a role in tru@@ mp &apos;s surprise victory last November .
T@@ y C@@ ob@@ b , special coun@@ sel to the president , said he was@@ n &apos;t aware that Mr. Mu@@ el@@ ler had started using a new g@@ rand ju@@ ry .
&quot; g@@ rand ju@@ ry matters are ty@@ p@@ ically secret , &quot; C@@ ob@@ b said in a statement .
the White House fav@@ ors anything that accele@@ rates the conclusion of his work fairly .
the White House is committed to fully cooperating with Mr. Mu@@ el@@ ler .
former F@@ B@@ I Director J@@ im Com@@ e@@ y said three times the President is not under investigation and we have no reason to believe that has changed . &quot;
Australia &apos;s Com@@ mon@@ wealth Bank accused of massive mon@@ e@@ y-@@ la@@ undering B@@ reaches
the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an government on Thursday accused the country &apos;s biggest mortgage len@@ der , Com@@ mon@@ wealth Bank of Australia , of widespread breaches of mon@@ e@@ y-@@ la@@ undering and counter-terrorism financing rules .
financial intelligence agency A@@ US@@ T@@ RA@@ C said it had initiated civil penalty proceedings in the Federal Court against Com@@ m@@ Bank for &quot; serious and systemic non-@@ compliance , &quot; in the biggest case of its kind in Australia and the first against a major bank .
&quot; the effect of Com@@ m@@ Bank &apos;s conduct in this matter has exposed the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an community to serious and ongoing financial crime , &quot; A@@ US@@ T@@ RA@@ C said in a court fil@@ ing .
Com@@ mon@@ wealth Bank said in a statement it was reviewing the allegations and would respond &quot; in due course . &quot;
Australia &apos;s biggest mortgage len@@ der failed to report sus@@ pi@@ cious matters &quot; either on time or at all involving transactions to@@ tal@@ ling over a@@ us $ 77 million ( $ 61 million ) , &quot; A@@ US@@ T@@ RA@@ C said .
the agency alleged 5@@ 3@@ ,@@ 700 contra@@ ven@@ tions of the anti-@@ money la@@ undering and counter-terrorism financing act , particularly with regards to so-called intelligent deposit mach@@ ines or I@@ D@@ Ms .
the previous biggest such case came against Australia &apos;s top boo@@ k@@ ma@@ ker Tab@@ cor@@ p Hol@@ dings , earlier this year , with only 108 alleged breaches .
Tab@@ cor@@ p paid A $ 45 million in fines , the biggest civil penalty in A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an corporate history .
an A@@ US@@ T@@ RA@@ C spokes@@ woman dec@@ lined to comment on possible penalties facing Com@@ m@@ Bank , or whether other banks could be in the agency &apos;s fir@@ ing line .
the maximum penalty for contra@@ ven@@ ing the anti-@@ money la@@ undering and counter terrorism financing law is a@@ us $ 18 million per breach .
I@@ D@@ Ms are a type of automa@@ ted tel@@ ler machine that accepts deposits by both cash and check , and facilitate anon@@ ymous cash deposits .
there had been significant growth in the use of Com@@ m@@ Bank &apos;s I@@ D@@ Ms since their rol@@ l@@ out in May 2012 , A@@ US@@ T@@ RA@@ C said .
cash deposits in the six months to June 201@@ 6 sur@@ ged to a@@ us $ 5.@@ 8 billion compared with a@@ us $ 89 million in the first six months after Com@@ m@@ Bank introduced the mach@@ ines .
cash was deposi@@ ted using fa@@ ke names with proce@@ eds going to drug impor@@ tation syn@@ di@@ cates , A@@ US@@ T@@ RA@@ C al@@ leges in its court fil@@ ings .
&quot; even after suspected money la@@ undering or struc@@ turing on Com@@ mb@@ an@@ k accounts had been brought to Com@@ m@@ Bank &apos;s attention , Com@@ m@@ Bank did not monitor its customers with a view to miti@@ gating and managing money la@@ undering / terrorism financing risk , &quot; the court fil@@ ing shows .
Com@@ m@@ Bank accounts were also used for &quot; cu@@ c@@ ko@@ o s@@ m@@ ur@@ f@@ ing , &quot; a form of money la@@ undering that involves transfers between countries without the need for money to actually cross international borders , A@@ US@@ T@@ RA@@ C added .
two power@@ house Women share The@@ ir secre@@ ts for success
what do Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ cor@@ an and La@@ ila Ali have in common ?
on paper , the women are from two very different worl@@ ds .
new York re@@ al-@@ es@@ tate ty@@ co@@ on , Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ cor@@ an , turned a $ 1@@ ,@@ 000 loan into a $ 5 billion real es@@ tate business , before taking her expertise to the small scre@@ en , serving on the pan@@ el of investors on A@@ B@@ C &apos;s shar@@ k Tan@@ k .
La@@ ila Ali followed in her father &apos;s foot@@ steps , becoming the most successful female in women &apos;s bo@@ xing as a four@@ -@@ time un@@ de@@ fe@@ ated champion before adding TV host , author and speaker to her resume .
yet despite ( or perhaps because of ) their unique career paths , T@@ J Ma@@ x@@ x en@@ listed the help of both women to talk breaking stereotypes and accomplis@@ hing lo@@ f@@ ty goals to a b@@ all@@ room full of hopeful entrepreneurs .
last year , T@@ .@@ J@@ . Ma@@ x@@ x spoke to hundreds of women in sto@@ res across the country and discovered that 80 percent feel ste@@ re@@ ot@@ y@@ ped by society into specific roles and expectations .
so they launched The Ma@@ x@@ x Y@@ ou Pro@@ ject aimed at helping women break those barriers .
which Cor@@ cor@@ on and Ali know a thing or two about : they may be at the top of their games now , but it was@@ n &apos;t a smooth road to success for either woman .
Cor@@ cor@@ an earned straight D &apos;s in high school and college , h@@ op@@ ped between 20 jobs by the time she turned 23 .
Ali entered one of the most mal@@ e-@@ dominated industries and had the added struggle of car@@ ving out her own place beyond the shadow of her global ic@@ on father .
to say the two are bri@@ m@@ ming with hard-@@ learned advice is an under@@ statement .
so we sat down with the two power@@ houses to talk overcoming failure , na@@ vig@@ ating success and trus@@ ting their gu@@ t in@@ st@@ inc@@ ts in business and relationships .
what in@@ spi@@ res both of you to do what you do every day ?
La@@ ila Ali : I &apos;@@ m inspired on a daily basis by my personal goals .
I make it a ha@@ bit to write down what it is that I want to accomp@@ lish .
and I check that list .
I keep myself accountable .
my k@@ ids insp@@ ire me , of course .
my ambition in@@ spi@@ res me .
I want to win at everything that I do in life .
I understand that it takes hard work to reach my goals and I &apos;@@ m prepared to do it .
my confidence comes from preparation .
so I spend a lot of my time preparing .
Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ cor@@ an : much like La@@ ila , over preparation is my key to confidence , but I don &apos;t get my inspiration from that .
I really get my inspiration from just she@@ er cu@@ ri@@ o@@ sity .
what will happen if I do this ?
what won &apos;t happen if I don &apos;t do this ?
that cu@@ ri@@ o@@ sity gets my feet on the floor in the morning , because I can &apos;t wait to see what the day brings .
when I don &apos;t feel that way on certain days , I pre@@ tend I feel that way .
then I start falling for my own bal@@ one@@ y and I get inspired again .
tell us about a hur@@ dle or a road@@ block in your career that ended up making you better in the long run ?
Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ cor@@ an : the hardest thing that happened to me was when my business partner and bo@@ y@@ friend left me and mar@@ ried my secre@@ tary .
I ended the business a year later , but for that year of my life - being the third whe@@ el - it was terrible , because I di@@ d@@ n &apos;t have the confidence to leave .
I felt shot down , un@@ inspired .
but amaz@@ ing things happen .
if only you could believe that when you &apos;@@ re getting hit , which is the hard part .
but getting back up and starting the business all over again , min@@ us the partner , was a very , very difficult year .
La@@ ila Ali : I would say one of the tou@@ gh@@ est times I &apos;@@ ve had in my career was when I was in bo@@ xing , I was at the he@@ ight of my career and decided I was going to get a divorce .
I was divor@@ cing not only my hus@@ band , but also my man@@ ager at the time and the person who taught me everything I knew about bo@@ xing .
I di@@ d@@ n &apos;t think that I could do it without him .
so I became concerned about the future of my career and had to take the time to step back and say , &quot; He@@ y , you have all the knowledge and expertise .
you have all this experience in the ring .
you can definitely do it . &quot;
so I surroun@@ ded myself with a new team of people and continued on with my career .
it was really just getting my mind@@ set in the right place because everything kind of took off from there .
I did what I needed to do and I had to face that fear and find the courage to get rid of my hus@@ band and my man@@ ager and continue on with my career and it worked out .
you felt like you really made it when ...
La@@ ila Ali : I felt like I really made it when I won my first champi@@ on@@ ship title .
it really felt good , because when I entered the sport of bo@@ xing I wanted to be one of the best and be un@@ de@@ fe@@ ated .
and I was able to attain that , not just one champi@@ on@@ ship title , but four .
Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ cor@@ an : the one point that I felt like I made it was my ele@@ venth year of business .
I finally made a profit .
I had close to $ 4@@ 2@@ ,@@ 000 in profit that I was not expecting .
so I immediately went out and I bought my mother and father each a new car ; they had never had a new car and I had it delivered to F@@ l@@ ori@@ da where they were reti@@ red .
I felt like the qu@@ e@@ en of England .
I felt so c@@ ool about myself .
I made much better money than that in ensu@@ ing years , but nothing ever measured up to the ability to give back to a parent and take them by surprise .
how did you stay motivated to keep working during that 1@@ 1@@ -year period ?
Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ cor@@ an : I never measured my business by profit , because that &apos;s not what I was in for .
I just wanted to see how far I could go .
I set my dream , day one , &quot; I want to be the qu@@ e@@ en of New York real es@@ tate . &quot;
and I pic@@ tured myself just like the P@@ ope with everybody k@@ is@@ sing my ring and ad@@ oring me .
and I had that little idea in my head .
so when I was running hard , day after day , hour after hour , I never really thought about making money .
I made money by accident eventually .
but any money I saw coming in , I p@@ low@@ ed right back into the business .
I don &apos;t even think I had discoura@@ ging days where I thought , &quot; O@@ h God , we &apos;@@ re not making money . &quot;
I just f@@ ig@@ u@@ red something was going to work out .
the worst that could happen is I lose my company and go back to being a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I made great ti@@ ps and I was happy then .
I could be happy again .
so I don &apos;t think money &apos;s a great aspi@@ ration for a lot of people that succeed .
they they have other motiva@@ tions that turn them on .
and money was not one of mine .
do you have advice for someone who has those big dre@@ ams , but the money factor is holding them back ?
Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ cor@@ an : when I started making a lot of money , I had money to invest in real es@@ tate , but I di@@ d@@ n &apos;t have the time .
I was building a business .
and so I found myself five different partners , who were specialists not even in the bro@@ k@@ er@@ age business , in different ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ hoo@@ ds around the city , who knew their streets inside and out .
and I approached them and said , &quot; Y@@ ou know this ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood .
find me the best building .
I &apos;@@ ll give you the money and you be my partner . &quot;
the lesson here is if you &apos;@@ ve got the money , you need people to make money with your money .
and if you have the tal@@ ent , you can always mer@@ ch@@ and@@ ise your tal@@ ent to someone who &apos;s got the money and make money .
there &apos;s two pieces to it : tal@@ ent and money .
and unless they &apos;@@ re together , nothing really big happens .
so I w@@ ound up doing very well , as did my partners , over all the years with these great investors that I would have never had if I ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t had the confidence to get some scrap@@ p@@ y person who really wanted to hus@@ tle .
you can always get the money if you believe that you have a tal@@ ent and you know your piece of the world better than anybody else .
let &apos;s talk morning rou@@ tine : what are two or three things that you do every single morning that set you up for success ?
La@@ ila Ali : I don &apos;t know about you , but there are lots of times in my life where I feel overwhel@@ med , just being a mo@@ m , a business@@ woman , a wife ... all the ha@@ ts that we wear as women .
and I came to a point in my life where I really had to establish a morning rou@@ tine .
I like to wake up and just feel gratitude .
gratitude for wa@@ king up , for my health , for my k@@ ids , for my family .
a lot of times in the evening , I &apos;@@ ll write down what my goals are for the next day ; W@@ hen I wake up , I look at that list again .
I medi@@ tate .
sometimes I j@@ our@@ nal .
I always have a cu@@ p of co@@ ff@@ e@@ e .
I always work out first thing in the morning , because if I don &apos;t , it won &apos;t get done .
to me , it really comes down to your priorities .
because those are the things that are important to me : my spiri@@ tu@@ ality , cen@@ tering with the uni@@ verse and God , and then getting my work@@ out in and putting my health first .
that makes everything else feel easy .
anything that comes up , I feel like I can con@@ qu@@ er it throughout the day .
Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ cor@@ an : I do prior@@ iti@@ ze .
I just go through my to-@@ do list , which is endless and ridiculous .
and I put down what my A &apos;s are .
what are the real priorities ?
and I try to be o@@ kay with just accomplis@@ hing the A &apos;s .
what do you do to psy@@ ch yourself up for a big meeting ?
Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ cor@@ an : I picture myself failing .
as we@@ ir@@ d as that is .
I think , &quot; O@@ h my God , I &apos;@@ m going to fail . &quot;
I sc@@ are the living da@@ y@@ lights out of myself and that gets me running hard .
I picture whoever is going to compete with me , and I &apos;@@ m so fier@@ c@@ ely competitive by nature , because I &apos;@@ m one of ten k@@ ids and we could never get my parents &apos; attention .
I get competitive .
and I always arrive very over prepared .
over preparation for me is my confidence buil@@ der .
La@@ ila Ali : it &apos;s amaz@@ ing that we &apos;@@ re so opposite on that .
we &apos;@@ re two successful people and it just goes to show how different things work for different people .
for me , I like to imagine being successful .
I like to imagine the end , which is success .
I en@@ vision it , where I can actually see it happening .
going into the ring , seeing the fight happen , seeing me win@@ ning that b@@ el@@ t , seeing me back in my d@@ ressing room celebrating with a sli@@ ce of ca@@ ke , which I always had .
and the same with meetings .
I do prepare though ; that confidence comes from preparation , because that fear is in the back of your head of not doing well , of not saying the right thing or having the right information .
that &apos;s where the preparation comes in for me .
but I always go in seeing the end result .
both of you have seen so much success in your own careers .
how are you paying it forward ?
La@@ ila Ali : I am so ex@@ cited to be a part of the T@@ .@@ J@@ . Ma@@ x@@ x Ma@@ x@@ x Y@@ ou Pro@@ ject , because I feel like this is a way of paying it forward and giving back .
there &apos;s so many women that need to be inspired , encouraged to go after their dre@@ ams , their goals , their aspirations .
because we all have that champion within us .
it really is about your mind@@ set and having the tools that you need , surrounding yourself with the right people , people who have been able to achieve some of the things that you want to achieve .
Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ cor@@ an : one of the things that I think I do very , very well is insp@@ ire people .
so in being asked to partner with the Ma@@ x@@ x Y@@ ou Pro@@ ject , I was th@@ ri@@ l@@ led .
I &apos;@@ m hoping to light the fire of indi@@ vi@@ du@@ ality and the inspiration that we &apos;@@ re seeing here in the faces of all these people and give them practical advice on how to move forward .
a lot of people can start with a dream , and then somewhere along the way , they get lost .
so we &apos;@@ re going to try to focus them .
everything &apos;s practical we &apos;@@ re teaching .
business planning , even something as simple as an ele@@ va@@ tor pit@@ ch , all the things that you need to build a business .
what specific advice do you have for women who working to succeed in mal@@ e-@@ dominated industries ?
La@@ ila Ali : I am in one of the number one mal@@ e-@@ dominated industries , bo@@ xing .
and then coming behind my father , who was a global ic@@ on and the greatest of all time , was pretty intimi@@ dating .
so for me , it was really about finding that tal@@ ent , that courage , that strength within myself .
the first thing I had to do was believe in myself that I could actually get in that ring and be successful .
it was@@ n &apos;t about anybody else , but me in that moment , and there we@@ re@@ n &apos;t going to be any limits on me , except those that I had on myself in my own mind .
when you believe in yourself and you find your passion , nobody can stop you .
Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ cor@@ an : there &apos;s a long distance between being inspired and having a view like I did , &quot; The qu@@ e@@ en of New York real es@@ tate , &quot; and actually running it over to the finish line .
and there &apos;s so many tal@@ ents you need in that in-@@ between stage , which is every day of your working career .
you don &apos;t have to be in the real es@@ tate bro@@ k@@ er@@ age business to need those tal@@ ents .
I &apos;@@ m sure in La@@ ila &apos;s field , you had to judge the right people , the right managers , when to start , when to stop , how much money you had , what you could enter , what you cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;t enter , how hard you wanted to work .
these are all judgment calls .
and I think I &apos;@@ m going to try to put a little fle@@ sh on the aspi@@ ration , for these women to really feel like , &quot; o@@ kay , I got it now .
let me run .
and here are my top three priorities . &quot;
if they leave with top three priorities to actually make it happen , I will go home tonight s@@ mil@@ ing as I go to bed .
what is sitting on your n@@ ight@@ stand right now ?
La@@ ila Ali : too much j@@ un@@ k .
ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ines , books , a little pra@@ yer an@@ gel , my j@@ our@@ nal .
probably a bot@@ tle of water .
Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ cor@@ an : my n@@ ight@@ stand has a little green wind@@ -up alarm clo@@ ck , because I was trying to break the ha@@ bit of looking at my phone first thing in the morning .
so I got it .
it was ad@@ or@@ able .
it has never run .
and it &apos;s still sitting there .
and I still have my phone on my n@@ ight@@ stand .
what book are you reading right now ?
Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ cor@@ an : how T@@ o W@@ in Fri@@ ends and influence People for the eigh@@ th time , maybe the n@@ in@@ th .
it keeps you on the straight and narrow .
I think it &apos;s still the best book written in the industry no matter what your dream is because you can &apos;t get to any of your dre@@ ams without people .
and it res@@ on@@ ates as real today as it ever did .
I like to read it every once in a@@ while .
gets me stra@@ igh@@ tened out again .
La@@ ila Ali : I &apos;@@ m in nutrition school , so I &apos;@@ m reading a book called whe@@ at bel@@ ly .
it just talks about eating gra@@ ins and how they affect our bodies .
I &apos;@@ m totally into it .
what is your best ti@@ p on na@@ vig@@ ating success and failure ?
Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ cor@@ an : ignore the na@@ y@@ sa@@ yers .
na@@ y@@ sa@@ yers come in all different forms .
you have to eliminate them from your brain vo@@ c@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary .
ste@@ er clear of compla@@ in@@ ers .
they su@@ ck your energy .
I think of compla@@ in@@ ers as th@@ ie@@ ves .
they come in the night , they gra@@ b your wal@@ let and they leave .
na@@ y@@ sa@@ yers in any kind of a team situation will ru@@ in the team faster than you could b@@ link an eye because people who are at a pity party need other people to feel sorry with .
they su@@ ck other good people down .
I &apos;@@ m excellent at avoiding anyone who &apos;s negative 50 mi@@ les away , because I plan on being positive and getting everything I want out of life and giving everything I can to life .
and so why would I want to spend a minute with anybody like that ?
La@@ ila Ali : be consistent .
so many times , we &apos;@@ re like , &quot; We &apos;@@ re going to be on the straight and narrow .
we &apos;@@ re going to do X , Y and Z@@ . &quot;
and people don &apos;t do it for long enough .
sometimes they give up just before they make it over that final hu@@ mp .
so I think that you have to stay the course .
if you &apos;@@ re passion@@ ate about something , you believe in it , then you have to be consistent .
and you have to put in the hard work that it takes to be successful .
Bar@@ bar@@ a Cor@@ cor@@ an : it &apos;s a lot of hard work to be consistent .
you know what being consistent takes ?
it takes fin@@ ishing .
you start it , you finish it .
so many people are good at starts and not so good at fin@@ ishing .
China &apos;s Internet cen@@ sors P@@ lay a tougher G@@ ame of c@@ at and Mo@@ use
the shift - which could affect a sw@@ ath of users from researchers to businesses - suggests that China is increasingly worried about the power of the internet , experts said .
&quot; it does appear the cra@@ ck@@ down is becoming more intense , but the internet is also more powerful than it has ever been , &quot; said E@@ mil@@ y Par@@ ker , author of &quot; N@@ o@@ w I K@@ now W@@ ho M@@ y com@@ ra@@ des A@@ re , &quot; a book about the power of the internet in China , Cuba , and Russia .
Beijing &apos;s cra@@ ck@@ down on the internet is commen@@ su@@ rate with the power of the internet in China .
China still has not clam@@ ped down to its full ability , the experts said , and in many cases the cat@@ -@@ and-@@ mo@@ use game continues .
one day after A@@ pp@@ le &apos;s move last week , people on Chinese social media began circu@@ lating a way to gain access to those tools that was so easy that even a non-@@ te@@ ch@@ i@@ e could use it .
it involved regis@@ tering a person &apos;s A@@ p@@ p store to another country where V@@ P@@ N A@@ pp@@ s were still available .
still , Thursday &apos;s test demonstrates that China wants the ability to change the game in fav@@ or of the c@@ at .
a number of Chinese internet service providers said on their social media accounts , websites , or in ema@@ ils on Thursday that Chinese security officials would test a new way to find the internet addresses of services ho@@ sting or using illegal content .
once found , these companies said , the authorities would ask internet service providers to tell their cli@@ ents to stop .
if the cli@@ ents persis@@ ted , they said , the service providers and Chinese officials would cut their connection in a matter of minutes .
the Ministry of Public Security did not respond to a fa@@ xed request for comment .
studies suggest that anywhere from tens of millions to well over a hundred million Chinese people use V@@ P@@ N@@ s and other types of sof@@ tw@@ are to get around the Great fire@@ wall .
while the blocks on foreign television shows and pornography ward off many people , they often pose only minor challenges to China &apos;s huge population of we@@ b-@@ sa@@ v@@ vy internet users .
China &apos;s president , X@@ I J@@ in@@ ping , has pre@@ si@@ ded over years of new internet controls , but he has also sing@@ led out technology and the internet as critical to China &apos;s future economic development .
as cyber@@ space has become more central to everything that happens in China , government controls have evol@@ ved .
it is difficult to figure out the extent of the new efforts , since many users and businesses will not discuss them publicly for fear of getting on the bad side with the Chinese government .
but some frequent users said that getting around the restrictions had become increasingly difficult .
one student , who has been stu@@ dying in the United States and was back in China for summer va@@ cation , said that her local V@@ P@@ N was blocked .
she said she had taken the period as a sort of medi@@ tation away from social media and left a note on F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k to warn her friends why she was a &quot; gone gir@@ l . &quot;
a doc@@ toral student in environmental engineering in at a university in China said it had become harder to do research without Google , though his university had found alternative publi@@ cations so that students did not always need the internet .
he has since found a new way to get around the Great fire@@ wall , the student said , without dis@@ closing what it was .
close observers of the Chinese internet said some V@@ P@@ N@@ s still work - and that China could still do a lot more to intensify its cra@@ ck@@ down .
&quot; we do think that if the government has decided to do so , it could have shut down much more V@@ P@@ N usage right now , &quot; said a spokes@@ man for V@@ P@@ N@@ Da@@ da , a website created in 2015 to help Chinese users find V@@ P@@ N@@ s that work .
&quot; if the government had sent more ca@@ ts , the m@@ ice would have a tougher time , &quot; said the spokes@@ man , who dec@@ lined to be named because of sensi@@ ti@@ vities around the group &apos;s work in China .
&quot; I gu@@ ess they di@@ d@@ n &apos;t do so because they need to give some air for people or businesses to brea@@ the . &quot;
China &apos;s online cra@@ ck@@ do@@ w@@ ns are often cyclical .
the current climate is in part the result of the le@@ ad@@ -up to a key Chinese Communist Party meeting , the 19@@ th Party Congress this autumn .
five years ago , ahead of a similar meeting , V@@ P@@ N@@ s were hit by th@@ en@@ -@@ unprecedented disrup@@ tions .
much like economic policy or foreign affairs , censorship in China is part of a complicated and often im@@ perfect political process .
government minis@@ tries feel pressure ahead of the party con@@ g@@ ress to show they are effective or can step in if a problem appears , analy@@ sts said .
&quot; so it &apos;s definitely not an a@@ po@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ se for V@@ P@@ N@@ s , &quot; said Paul Tri@@ ol@@ o , head of global technology at E@@ u@@ ra@@ sia Group , a consul@@ tan@@ cy .
&quot; just a more complex environment for users to na@@ vig@@ ate , and new capabilities and approaches give China better ability to shut off some del@@ ta of V@@ P@@ N use at a time and place of Beijing &apos;s choosing , &quot; he said .
China &apos;s population is learning to deal with those difficulties at a younger age .
earlier this summer , China &apos;s internet gi@@ ant T@@ en@@ cent began limiting the time that people under 18 were allowed to play the popular online game hon@@ or of K@@ ings to an hour a day for those under 12 , and two hours for those age 12 to 18 .
so Chinese y@@ ou@@ ths have taken to an age@@ -@@ old solution : getting a fa@@ ke I@@ D .
&quot; your hon@@ or of K@@ ings being limited ?
interested in getting an over-@@ 18 identification ? &quot; read a recent advertise@@ ment on Chinese social media .
&quot; no problem .
get in touch for a low-@@ price I@@ D . &quot;
he W@@ on praise for H@@ al@@ ting a Global cyber@@ attack .
then H@@ e was arrested .
when the K@@ ron@@ os mal@@ w@@ are was first adver@@ tised in under@@ ground Russian forums in 2014 , the asking price of $ 7@@ ,@@ 000 indicated that the selling of mal@@ w@@ are was a lu@@ cra@@ tive business .
K@@ ron@@ os was promoted as a ha@@ cking tool that could re@@ tri@@ eve data including user names and pas@@ s@@ words , A@@ .@@ T@@ .@@ M@@ . p@@ ins , and personal information useful in cra@@ cking security questions .
earlier on Thursday , M@@ o@@ ther@@ board reported that Mr. Hu@@ t@@ ch@@ ins had been detained at the L@@ as V@@ e@@ gas airport after a week of attending both the Black hat and D@@ ef@@ c@@ on security conferences .
he had been scheduled to fly back to his home in the United Kingdom .
the security community reacted with surprise and s@@ ke@@ p@@ ticism over the arrest of one of its well-@@ regarded sta@@ rs .
some warned that claims against Mr. Hu@@ t@@ ch@@ ins could stra@@ in the relationship between &quot; white hat &quot; ha@@ c@@ kers - researchers who look for sof@@ tw@@ are v@@ ul@@ ner@@ abilities to spot problems and fix them , rather than to commit a crime or so@@ w chaos - and law enforcement .
others were un@@ convinced that Mr. Hu@@ t@@ ch@@ ins would create such sof@@ tw@@ are for an attack .
in July 2014 , he asked on T@@ wit@@ ter if anyone had a K@@ ron@@ os sam@@ ple - a seem@@ ingly od@@ d request if he had created the mal@@ w@@ are .
while the exact circumstances of Mr. Hu@@ t@@ ch@@ ins &apos;s involvement with the K@@ ron@@ os mal@@ w@@ are were unclear , security researchers have often s@@ k@@ ir@@ ted legal trouble while looking for v@@ ul@@ ner@@ abilities in computer code .
in recent years , big te@@ ch companies have created &quot; bu@@ g boun@@ ties &quot; to form@@ ali@@ ze a process for researchers to report problems and to be compensa@@ ted for their work .
the D@@ ef@@ c@@ on conference , a fre@@ e@@ wh@@ eel@@ ing gathering of security experts from around the world , has also had a tou@@ ch@@ y relationship with law enforcement .
in 2002 , for example , the Federal Bureau of In@@ ves@@ ti@@ gation arrested a Russian en@@ c@@ ry@@ ption expert in his L@@ as V@@ e@@ gas ho@@ tel room after he published sof@@ tw@@ are officials said could cra@@ ck the security of some kinds of e-@@ books .
the Elec@@ tron@@ ic Fron@@ ti@@ er Foundation , a digital rights organ@@ iz@@ ation , said in a statement that it was concerned about the arrest of Mr. Hu@@ t@@ ch@@ ins and was looking into the matter .
the W@@ an@@ na@@ C@@ ry r@@ ans@@ om@@ w@@ are infected compu@@ ters running older versions of Mic@@ ro@@ soft W@@ ind@@ o@@ ws .
once spread , the sof@@ tw@@ are en@@ c@@ ry@@ p@@ ted compu@@ ters and lo@@ cked users out of files , fol@@ ders and dri@@ ves .
if an affected machine was connected to a network , other compu@@ ters on the network could become infected as well .
the atta@@ c@@ kers demanded that victims pay hundreds of dollars to a B@@ it@@ co@@ in address .
Mr. Hu@@ t@@ ch@@ ins was something of an ac@@ ci@@ den@@ tal her@@ o .
according to an inter@@ view with The Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an in May , Mr. Hu@@ t@@ ch@@ ins said he registered a website domain after dis@@ covering that the m@@ ali@@ cious sof@@ tw@@ are was trying to connect to it .
by regis@@ tering the domain for $ 10@@ .@@ 69 , he triggered a so-called kill switch that hal@@ ted the sof@@ tw@@ are &apos;s spread .
his intention initially was not to stop the attack but to track its spread .
Mr. Hu@@ t@@ ch@@ ins , who works as a rese@@ ar@@ cher for K@@ ry@@ p@@ to@@ s logic , a L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les@@ -based cyber@@ security firm , said in the inter@@ view that he had ski@@ pped going to college and taught himself how to write sof@@ tw@@ are .
the company did not respond to a request for comment .
Mr. Hu@@ t@@ ch@@ ins tried to remain anon@@ ymous , communic@@ ating with the media through his handle Mal@@ wa@@ re@@ T@@ ec@@ h , but British tab@@ lo@@ ids revealed his identity .
he was celebrated in the cyber@@ security community for his achievement , win@@ ning a special recognition award at an S@@ C A@@ wards Europe industry event .
tru@@ mp called New H@@ amp@@ shire a &quot; D@@ ru@@ g@@ -@@ inf@@ es@@ ted D@@ en , &quot; drawing the ire of its P@@ oli@@ tici@@ ans
&quot; the president is wrong , &quot; said Go@@ v@@ . Ch@@ ris S@@ un@@ un@@ u of New H@@ amp@@ shire , a Re@@ publi@@ can .
it &apos;s disappointing his mis@@ charac@@ teri@@ z@@ ation of this epidemic igno@@ res the great things this state has to offer .
Sen@@ ator Mag@@ gi@@ e H@@ ass@@ an , Democra@@ t of New H@@ amp@@ shire , called his remarks &quot; dis@@ gus@@ ting &quot; and said on T@@ wit@@ ter that her state was no different from any other that was bat@@ tling widespread op@@ i@@ o@@ id abuse .
Sen@@ ator Je@@ an@@ ne Sha@@ he@@ en , also a Democra@@ t , agreed .
&quot; it &apos;s absolutely unacceptable for the President to be talking about N@@ H in this way , &quot; she wrote on T@@ wit@@ ter .
a gross mis@@ representation of N@@ H &amp; the epidemic .
addiction to op@@ i@@ o@@ ids - a category of drugs that includes hero@@ in and f@@ en@@ tan@@ y@@ l - is the most le@@ th@@ al drug epidemic in American history .
drug over@@ do@@ ses killed more people in 201@@ 6 than gun@@ s or car accidents - an estimated 5@@ 9@@ ,@@ 000 people , according to data analy@@ zed by The New York Times - and are now the leading cause of death for Americans under the age of 50 .
more than 97 million people in the United States took prescription pain@@ kil@@ lers in 2015 , according to the substance Ab@@ use and M@@ ental Health Services Administration .
an estimated 12 million of those did so in ways that were not san@@ c@@ tioned by a doctor , it said .
new H@@ amp@@ shire has been hit hard , and residents repeatedly raised the issue with presidential candidates during the 201@@ 6 campaign .
there were an estimated 4@@ 70 drug over@@ do@@ se deaths in New H@@ amp@@ shire in 201@@ 6 , compared with 4@@ 39 in 2015 .
in 2012 , there were 16@@ 3 , according to statistics compi@@ led by the New H@@ amp@@ shire De@@ part@@ ment of Health and Human Services .
on Thursday , Mr. S@@ un@@ un@@ u described the op@@ i@@ o@@ id epidemic in an ema@@ il as &quot; one of the worst health crises this state has ever experienced . &quot;
he said the government had doubled the resources devoted to prevention , treatment and recovery efforts .
he said it had also spent millions of dollars on prevention program@@ s for children , law enforcement to end drug trafficking and initiatives to expand the availability of n@@ al@@ o@@ x@@ one , which is used to treat drug over@@ do@@ ses .
Mar@@ ty S@@ k@@ la@@ r , long@@ time Dis@@ ne@@ y a@@ ide and Executive , dies at 83
Mr. S@@ k@@ la@@ r , who died on July 27 at his home in the Hol@@ ly@@ wood hil@@ ls ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood of L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les , maintained his connection to the company after his retirement in 2009 ( ti@@ med for the 5@@ 4@@ th anniversary of Dis@@ ne@@ y@@ land &apos;s opening ) .
last year , at Day 1 of S@@ han@@ g@@ ha@@ i Dis@@ ne@@ y in China , he became the only cast member , as the company calls its workers , to have attended the open@@ ings of all 12 Dis@@ ne@@ y par@@ ks worldwide .
and less than two weeks before he died , he was at d@@ 23 , a Dis@@ ne@@ y fan convention , re@@ minis@@ cing on a pan@@ el about Dis@@ ne@@ y@@ land .
his death was announced by the Dis@@ ne@@ y company , which did not give a cause .
he was 83 .
Mr. S@@ k@@ la@@ r &apos;s job ed@@ iting The Dis@@ ne@@ y@@ land Ne@@ ws was a temporary one , but he returned to Dis@@ ne@@ y@@ land after gradu@@ ating from U@@ .@@ C@@ .@@ L@@ .@@ A@@ . in 195@@ 6 to work in its publi@@ city depart@@ ment .
he soon became Mr. Dis@@ ne@@ y &apos;s chief g@@ ho@@ st@@ wri@@ ter for publi@@ city materials , De@@ di@@ cations , sou@@ ven@@ ir gu@@ ides , speeches , slo@@ gan@@ s , presen@@ tations and short fil@@ ms , like the one that helped the company win approval to build W@@ al@@ t Dis@@ ne@@ y World and E@@ p@@ co@@ t in central F@@ l@@ ori@@ da .
he also collabor@@ ated with W@@ al@@ t and his bro@@ ther , Ro@@ y , on Dis@@ ne@@ y &apos;s annual reports .
&quot; it was pretty head@@ y stu@@ ff for someone just closing in on his 30@@ th bir@@ th@@ day and only six or seven years out of college , &quot; Mr. S@@ k@@ la@@ r wrote in his auto@@ bio@@ graph@@ y , &quot; D@@ rea@@ m It ! do It : my half-@@ century C@@ reat@@ ing Dis@@ ne@@ y &apos;s ma@@ gic K@@ ing@@ dom@@ s &quot; ( 2013 ) .
but even as Mr. Dis@@ ne@@ y le@@ an@@ ed on Mr. S@@ k@@ la@@ r &apos;s writing , he assigned him to work on the Ford Pa@@ vi@@ lion at the 196@@ 4 World &apos;s F@@ air in New York , where the Dis@@ ne@@ y company was de@@ signing ex@@ hi@@ b@@ its and attra@@ ctions .
Mr. S@@ k@@ la@@ r wrote Mr. Dis@@ ne@@ y &apos;s nar@@ ration for the &quot; ma@@ gic S@@ k@@ y@@ way &quot; at the Ford pa@@ vi@@ lion , with its anim@@ at@@ ron@@ ic din@@ o@@ sa@@ urs and ca@@ ve men , and was the main link to major corporate spon@@ sors .
it was the start of Mr. S@@ k@@ la@@ r &apos;s second phase at the company .
as an increasingly important member , and leader , of the I@@ mag@@ ine@@ ers , he became even more identified with the legacy of Mr. Dis@@ ne@@ y , who died in late 196@@ 6 , well before the open@@ ings of W@@ al@@ t Dis@@ ne@@ y World , in 197@@ 1 , and E@@ p@@ co@@ t , in 198@@ 2 .
after Mr. Dis@@ ne@@ y &apos;s death of l@@ ung cancer at 65 , Mr. S@@ k@@ la@@ r was thrust back into writing when he was told that the company &apos;s top execu@@ tives had not prepared a public statement in advance , even though , as he wrote in his auto@@ bio@@ graph@@ y , &quot; it was no secret W@@ al@@ t was dying . &quot;
Mr. S@@ k@@ la@@ r re@@ sen@@ ted having to write the statement that Ro@@ y Dis@@ ne@@ y would sign , he said , but he understood that the lack of planning was a sign that Mr. Dis@@ ne@@ y &apos;s death had paraly@@ zed the company &apos;s leaders .
&quot; the truth is they were all sca@@ red as hel@@ l , &quot; Mr. S@@ k@@ la@@ r wrote .
Martin Adri@@ an S@@ k@@ la@@ r was born in New B@@ run@@ sw@@ ick , N@@ .@@ J@@ . , on F@@ eb@@ .
his father , Le@@ on , was a teacher , and his mother , the former L@@ il@@ y@@ n Fu@@ ch@@ s , worked at J@@ oh@@ n@@ son &amp; J@@ oh@@ n@@ son before the family moved to L@@ ong be@@ ach , C@@ ali@@ f . , when Mar@@ ty was 12 .
after high school , he had temporary jobs working at D@@ ou@@ g@@ l@@ as Air@@ cra@@ ft , s@@ co@@ oping ice crea@@ m at a h@@ amb@@ ur@@ ger dri@@ ve-@@ in and delivering packages for the Po@@ sta@@ l Service .
but in May 19@@ 55 , as his j@@ uni@@ or year at U@@ .@@ C@@ .@@ L@@ .@@ A@@ . was ending , Mr. S@@ k@@ la@@ r received a message to call E@@ . Car@@ don W@@ al@@ ker , the head of marketing and publi@@ city at Dis@@ ne@@ y .
at the time , Mr. S@@ k@@ la@@ r was the new ed@@ it@@ or in chief of The Da@@ ily B@@ ru@@ in , the U@@ .@@ C@@ .@@ L@@ .@@ A@@ . student newspaper .
Mr. W@@ al@@ ker asked him to inter@@ view for the job of creating and ed@@ iting The Dis@@ ne@@ y@@ land Ne@@ ws .
the theme par@@ k was opening soon , Mr. W@@ al@@ ker told him .
it needed him .
Mr. W@@ al@@ ker hi@@ red him after a 20-@@ minute inter@@ view .
but Mr. S@@ k@@ la@@ r still needed to assure Mr. Dis@@ ne@@ y that he knew what he was doing .
&quot; I was on the job two weeks and had to present the concept for the paper to W@@ al@@ t Dis@@ ne@@ y , &quot; he recalled in a po@@ d@@ cast for the Dis@@ ne@@ y a@@ ven@@ ue website .
&quot; if W@@ al@@ t di@@ d@@ n &apos;t like it , I was out the door , and he &apos;@@ d get a pr@@ o to do it .
but the good fortu@@ ne was that W@@ al@@ t liked it .
I was 21 .
it was sc@@ ary .
I &apos;@@ d never worked profession@@ ally . &quot;
Mr. S@@ k@@ la@@ r eventually dis@@ til@@ led Mr. Dis@@ ne@@ y &apos;s lessons ( and some from others ) into &quot; Mic@@ key &apos;s T@@ en Com@@ m@@ and@@ ments , &quot; a manifes@@ to of theme par@@ k management .

Bo@@ b R@@ og@@ ers , an expert in the@@ med enter@@ tain@@ ment , once called Mr. S@@ k@@ la@@ r &quot; the sor@@ ce@@ rer &apos;s app@@ ren@@ ti@@ ce &quot; - the role Mic@@ key Mo@@ use played in the Dis@@ ne@@ y classi@@ c &quot; fan@@ ta@@ sia &quot; ( 19@@ 40 ) - for chan@@ n@@ el@@ ing the Dis@@ ne@@ y p@@ hil@@ os@@ ophi@@ es to three generations of de@@ sig@@ ners .
Mr. S@@ k@@ la@@ r is survi@@ ved by his wife , the former Le@@ a@@ h Ger@@ ber ; his da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter L@@ es@@ lie S@@ k@@ la@@ r ; his son Ho@@ ward ; and four grand@@ children .
Mr. S@@ k@@ la@@ r was a de@@ v@@ out Dis@@ ne@@ y executive .
he rou@@ tin@@ ely wor@@ e a three-@@ faced Mic@@ key Mo@@ use watch ( which gave him the times in L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les , Paris and T@@ o@@ k@@ y@@ o ) and a gold Mic@@ key Mo@@ use ring .
and he never for@@ got all that Mr. Dis@@ ne@@ y had taught him .
when the Dis@@ ne@@ y company was developing a children &apos;s area for the C@@ ali@@ for@@ nia ad@@ venture Par@@ k , Mr. S@@ k@@ la@@ r reminded the plan@@ ners to include activities that parents and children could do together , as Mr. Dis@@ ne@@ y would have man@@ da@@ ted .
&quot; I reminded everyone that the reason Dis@@ ne@@ y@@ land existed at all was because W@@ al@@ t used to take his da@@ u@@ gh@@ ters Di@@ an@@ e and S@@ har@@ on to the G@@ ri@@ ff@@ it@@ h Par@@ k mer@@ r@@ y-@@ go@@ -@@ round , &quot; he told The L@@ os An@@ ge@@ les Times in 2002 , &quot; and D@@ ad@@ dy had to sit on the par@@ k ben@@ ch eating pe@@ anu@@ ts and po@@ p@@ cor@@ n while the k@@ ids ro@@ de alone . &quot;
he Th@@ ought H@@ e H@@ ad caught H@@ is co-@@ worker &apos;s st@@ om@@ ach Bu@@ g .
why W@@ ere H@@ is symp@@ toms S@@ o different ?
in the E@@ .@@ R@@ . , he was given high-@@ do@@ se ac@@ e@@ ta@@ min@@ op@@ hen to bring his fe@@ ver down .
and he spent the rest of the day being questioned , pro@@ d@@ ded , po@@ ked and scan@@ ned .
none of the tests were reveal@@ ing , but no one wanted to send him home , either .
he understood why .
for the past two years , he &apos;@@ d been taking a medi@@ cation called et@@ an@@ er@@ cep@@ t for S@@ jo@@ gre@@ n &apos;s sy@@ nd@@ ro@@ me .
the drug works by ta@@ mp@@ ing down the immun@@ e system , and that limited his ability to fight off infections .
S@@ jo@@ gre@@ n &apos;s is an au@@ to@@ im@@ m@@ un@@ e dis@@ order - a somewhat my@@ ste@@ rious type of disease in which the body &apos;s own white blood cells attack normal t@@ issue as if it were an inva@@ ding organ@@ ism - in this case w@@ rea@@ king ha@@ vo@@ c on the g@@ lands that make te@@ ars and s@@ ali@@ va , as well as on some of the join@@ ts .
a wee@@ kly in@@ jec@@ tion of et@@ an@@ er@@ cep@@ t had been helpful , eliminating his joint pain .
but he knew that because of this drug , he was almost hel@@ ple@@ ss in the face of a serious infection .
once the ac@@ e@@ ta@@ min@@ op@@ hen kic@@ ked in , the patient felt much better .
the E@@ .@@ R@@ . doctors decided to admit him overnight .
if , as the doctors suspected , he had a virus , he &apos;@@ d be fine the next day and could go home .
when G@@ ir@@ ard first heard about her new patient , she read up on the infections to which people who took et@@ an@@ er@@ cep@@ t were sus@@ cep@@ tible .
it was a long list .
vi@@ ru@@ ses cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;t be treated before diagnosis , so she focused on bac@@ terial infections .
one bac@@ teri@@ um that attacks those with immun@@ e deficiencies is food@@ -@@ borne and called lis@@ teri@@ a .
it is often found in un@@ pas@@ te@@ u@@ ri@@ zed milk and che@@ e@@ ses and ten@@ ds to cause horri@@ ble na@@ use@@ a , v@@ om@@ iting and di@@ ar@@ r@@ he@@ a , which he di@@ d@@ n &apos;t have .
Le@@ gi@@ on@@ ella p@@ ne@@ u@@ mon@@ ia is another infection more common in those who take the medi@@ cation , but he di@@ d@@ n &apos;t have a c@@ ou@@ gh and was@@ n &apos;t short of b@@ reat@@ h .
a much more common bu@@ g , sta@@ p@@ h au@@ re@@ us , could cause joint infections - though again , he di@@ d@@ n &apos;t have any complaints about his join@@ ts .
still , she planned to start him on broad@@ -@@ spectrum antibiotics to cover all these threats .
but when she met him , he di@@ d@@ n &apos;t look like someone who had a terrible infection .
the doctors in the E@@ .@@ R@@ . ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t given him antibiotics .
she could hold off on the antibiotics and just watch and wait - but if he had one of the infections she &apos;@@ d read about , delaying treatment even a few hours could be dead@@ ly .
to make matters more complicated , he thought he was aller@@ gic to pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin - though he cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;t remember what happened when he took it .
this shif@@ ted the risk@@ -@@ benefit ratio .
the normally low-@@ s@@ takes decision of whether to start an antibio@@ tic changed when doing so could be so dangerous .
she asked a colleague , another resident , to assess the patient .
G@@ ir@@ ard di@@ d@@ n &apos;t tell her co-@@ worker that she planned on an antibio@@ tic ; she just asked her to see the patient and give a recommendation .
the co-@@ worker saw the patient and agreed .
even though he looked well , if he had an infection , he was practically defen@@ se@@ less against it .
she should give him the antibiotics .
because he had a history of a pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin aller@@ gy , G@@ ir@@ ard would have to test him to make sure he could tolerate the medi@@ cation , which was not pen@@ ic@@ il@@ lin but a close co@@ us@@ in .
G@@ ir@@ ard ordered a test do@@ se to be given .
if he was going to have a serious reaction to the medicine , he would have a ras@@ h or his blood pressure would drop .
neither happened .
so he got the full do@@ se .
a couple of hours later , G@@ ir@@ ard got a call .
the patient had s@@ p@@ ik@@ ed a temperature of 10@@ 2 .
she ran down to see him .
his face was sh@@ in@@ y with a th@@ in la@@ yer of swe@@ at , and his che@@ e@@ ks were ro@@ sy .
and though he looked un@@ comfortable , his heart and blood pressure were fine .
thank good@@ ness she &apos;@@ d given him antibiotics , she thought to herself .
she ordered another do@@ se of Ty@@ len@@ ol , and when she came back for one final look at him , he was sound as@@ lee@@ p .
his temperature was gone .
the swe@@ at@@ y g@@ le@@ am and ro@@ sy che@@ e@@ ks had disappeared .
the next night , when G@@ ir@@ ard returned to the hospital for her overnight shift , the first thing she did was check on this patient .
she had admitted five other patients , but he was the one she worried about from home after signing him over to the day team .
in the hours since she last saw him , his blood had grown an organ@@ ism in the la@@ b .
it was too early to know precisely what it was .
but it was clear that it was bac@@ teri@@ a robust enough to grow quickly in a pe@@ tr@@ i dis@@ h and that it was@@ n &apos;t sta@@ p@@ h au@@ re@@ us or Le@@ gi@@ on@@ ella .
the list of other possibilities was long , and none really seemed to fit .
it was another two days before they could finally identify the bu@@ g .
it was lis@@ teri@@ a .
G@@ ir@@ ard - and just about everyone caring for the man - was surprised .
as a physi@@ cian , you get these pic@@ tures in your head about diseases .
for G@@ ir@@ ard , lis@@ teri@@ o@@ sis was a disease that you got from un@@ pas@@ te@@ u@@ ri@@ zed milk and soft che@@ e@@ ses and that caused na@@ use@@ a , v@@ om@@ iting and di@@ ar@@ r@@ he@@ a .
she did a little more reading on the unusual infection and found that while people with normal immun@@ e systems may experience these symp@@ toms , they usually recover quickly , like the patient &apos;s co-@@ worker .
in pregnant women , people over 65 or anyone with an im@@ pa@@ ired immun@@ e system , however , the infection can break out of the dig@@ es@@ tive tra@@ ct - sometimes without manifes@@ ting the typical symp@@ toms - and get into the bloo@@ d@@ stream .
from there it can spread like wil@@ d@@ fire through the entire body .
this form of the infection , called inva@@ sive lis@@ teri@@ o@@ sis , can be fatal up to 30 percent of the time in these patients .
indeed , though less common than bo@@ tu@@ lis@@ m , lis@@ teri@@ o@@ sis can be just as dead@@ ly .
early treatment with antibiotics can be lif@@ es@@ a@@ ving .
if this was a food@@ -@@ borne illness , which food had carried the bac@@ teri@@ a ?
though the man and his co-@@ worker did not have un@@ pas@@ te@@ u@@ ri@@ zed milk or soft che@@ ese on their trip , an internet search showed an outbreak of lis@@ teri@@ a this summer in Scotland linked to smo@@ ked beef .
neither of them had ea@@ ten smo@@ ked beef , but they had shared some smo@@ ked sal@@ m@@ on .
exactly where they &apos;@@ d pic@@ ked up the bu@@ g remained a my@@ ster@@ y .
once the medical team knew what he had , they could tail@@ or the antibiotics .
he completed his three-@@ week treatment in July .
his doctors instru@@ cted him to take it easy for the rest of the summer , but at this point he feels mostly back to normal and has returned to his mu@@ se@@ um and the work he lo@@ ves .
Pakistani H@@ in@@ dus fail to find asylum in India
seven@@ ty years after the biggest migration in history preci@@ pi@@ ta@@ ted by the parti@@ tion of the two countries , H@@ in@@ dus are still moving from Pakistan to India .
in sha@@ b@@ by camps located on the border between two countries , tens of thousands of people are there before them , people who don &apos;t even have a legal right to work in India .
thus many have no other choice but to to@@ il away illegally in stone qu@@ arri@@ es near temporary d@@ wel@@ l@@ ings - the Indian authorities keep a close eye on the movements of those who have come from the other side of the border .
most of the arri@@ vals from Pakistan would never have expected such a reception .
no work , no house , no money , no food .
there we worked in the fields , we were farm fol@@ k .
here people like us are forced to split stone in order to earn a living , &quot; said J@@ og@@ d@@ as , 81 .
for us , parti@@ tion is@@ n &apos;t over .
H@@ in@@ dus are still trying to return to their country .
and when they come here , they don &apos;t have anything , &quot; added an elderly man living in a field camp near the city of Jo@@ d@@ h@@ pu@@ r .
after India gained independence from the British E@@ mp@@ ire in 19@@ 47 , over 15 million people lost their homes .
the parti@@ tion led to a wave of violence that las@@ ted months , in which at least 1 million people lost their lives due to religious stri@@ fe .
am@@ id@@ st the bloody chaos , H@@ in@@ dus and S@@ ik@@ h@@ s fled recently established Pakistan ; Muslims moved in the opposite direction .
despite the emig@@ ration , H@@ in@@ dus are still one of the most numerous minority groups in Pakistan .
according to various estimates they make up about 1.@@ 6 % of the country &apos;s 200@@ -@@ mil@@ li@@ on-@@ strong population .
many of them complain of constant discrimination and fear rob@@ ber@@ y , rape , and forced marriage .
&quot; the persecution started soon after parti@@ tion , &quot; said J@@ og@@ d@@ as , whose family moved to what is now Pakistan a couple months before parti@@ tion , due to drought .
there has@@ n &apos;t been a single day where we &apos;@@ ve been able to live in peace .
I wanted to come back to live among my H@@ ind@@ u bro@@ thers .
the nationalist government of Indian Prime Minister N@@ ar@@ end@@ ra mo@@ di wants to make it easier for those persecuted on religious grounds to find asylum in India .
last year the government made it possible for immigrants to apply for citizenship in their place of residence ; previously the whole process has gone through the central government .
H@@ in@@ dus who reset@@ tle from Pakistan to India get the opportunity for expedi@@ ted citizenship after they &apos;@@ ve lived in the country for seven years .
due to bureaucratic delays , the process often takes significantly more time .
6@@ 4-@@ year-old K@@ han@@ ar@@ am@@ j@@ i left Pakistan in 1997 and received Indian citizenship in 2005 .
but he says many have given up and gone back to Pakistan because they see that there &apos;s no good life waiting for them in India .
the government offers no support .
we &apos;@@ re like lost sheep .
we just try to stay alive on our own , &quot; says K@@ han@@ ar@@ am@@ j@@ i .
but even worse than poverty is the scepticism from the authorities .
people who lack citizenship have to endu@@ re oppression from intelligence agencies .
they are constantly treated like suspects and Pakistani agents , &quot; he explained .
S@@ ing@@ h So@@ d@@ h@@ al , who started a ch@@ arity organ@@ iz@@ ation in Jo@@ d@@ h@@ pu@@ r devoted to assisting H@@ in@@ dus from Pakistan , had great expectations in mo@@ di when he came to power in 2014 , but has grown dis@@ il@@ lus@@ i@@ oned .
tensions between India and Pakistan have grown during the mo@@ di administration and migrants bear the br@@ unt .
&quot; their life is becoming a hel@@ l , &quot; said So@@ d@@ h@@ al .
for many , however , this kind of treatment is better than life in Pakistan .
Ho@@ ro@@ j@@ i and his two adult s@@ ons fled to India two years ago as he had started receiving death threats from his Pakistani neighbours .
&quot; to save our lives we had to fle@@ e to India , &quot; said Ho@@ ro@@ j@@ i , 65 , whose grand@@ parents where originally from what is now India but found themselves on the wrong side of the border when the country split up .
my grand@@ father moved to the other side for work reasons .
but he told us to move to India when the time was right because he had a sense the future could prove dangerous for H@@ in@@ dus .
Monday was the last opportunity to suggest a name for a r@@ hin@@ oce@@ ros born in early June .

J@@ ü@@ r@@ i K@@ ol@@ k : rest throughout the year so you don &apos;t need a holiday
naturally , I had only myself to blame for the fact that I di@@ d@@ n &apos;t va@@ cation during this holiday period .
I suppose I was a somewhat necessary employee , but I also gu@@ ess I was the only one who considered himself irre@@ pla@@ ceable .
I myself was to blame for the fo@@ ol@@ ish sense of duty that gri@@ pped my ch@@ est .
what &apos;s great about the quo@@ tation in the head@@ line of this c@@ olu@@ mn is that it &apos;s completely true .
and so it was - the new job I started in March of this year has required its fair share of working , but something about the job was so much of a better fit for me that in just three months I reco@@ vered to a completely new life , feeling like I was totally res@@ ted .
it &apos;s still summer now , a time for going on holiday .
it &apos;s time to make a New Year &apos;s resolution , to take stock of what has happened in life and what direction all this stu@@ ff is heading .
&quot; Christmas and New Year &apos;s are the time for that ! &quot; someone is bound to exc@@ la@@ i@@ m , cross@@ ly .
well , no doubt it is , but we all know from our experience that Christmas is not a good time to think about one &apos;s life and set goals .
all right , I &apos;@@ m speaking only for myself here , but I certainly am not capable of making any change around New Year &apos;s .
it &apos;s too difficult a time for me .
of course , there &apos;s lo@@ ads of jo@@ y and good che@@ er during Chris@@ t@@ mas@@ time : I like knowing that the light is about to return , I like Christmas lights and J@@ es@@ us himself has a totally con@@ gen@@ ial outlook , a revolu@@ tionary kind of gu@@ y .
still , in spite of that , I generally find myself very we@@ ary and sometimes stressed out around Christmas - because that same dar@@ k@@ ness .
yes , in leading a va@@ ca@@ tion@@ -free life , I end up doing a good amount of work , perhaps more than I would in some dam@@ ned slaugh@@ ter@@ house , and I constantly feel fairly res@@ ted .
mostly , I end up like a ham@@ ster on a whe@@ el in the time leading up to Christmas - presents , at least four Christmas parties , a slightly hea@@ vi@@ er work@@ load ...
factor in the in@@ cess@@ ant social pressure to feel jo@@ y and peace in your heart under any circumstances , and the hard@@ ship of Christmas is pretty plain to see .
but a person who is we@@ ary and at their w@@ it &apos;s end is@@ n &apos;t capable of taking good decisions , to say nothing of improving on them in the form of a plan .
such things have to be decided with a more or less clear head .
a person who &apos;s ti@@ red will to@@ ss up empty but generous promises that are about as useful for laying the future &apos;s foundation as buying a lo@@ t@@ tery ticket .
a promise that is meant to change something has to be thought through cal@@ mly ; it should increase the benefits ; it should be a plan .
unlike a promise , a plan contains not just a goal but also a roadmap for action and do@@ es@@ n &apos;t just break after a few tin@@ y set@@ backs .
that &apos;s why I say that the best time to come up with promises is right now , in the summer .
you just have to rest up cal@@ mly and de@@ du@@ ce why you &apos;@@ re so ti@@ red ( if you are ) .
if you don &apos;t force yourself to bol@@ t around during your va@@ cation like a cal@@ f that &apos;s got out of the pen , a couple weeks is enough to find in your life , some cro@@ o@@ ked part that needs to be b@@ ent straight , and to think about how exactly to go about doing that .
I consider it important to live , as much as possible , so that I don &apos;t need a va@@ cation , so that I rest up on a running basis , not once a year .
in this way , a holiday would be an extra pleasure , not a com@@ part@@ men@@ tali@@ zed stop you need to survive , and during which you re@@ charge just enough to somehow get through the next year .
I recommend that everyone make one simple summer resolution - if you have to get up tomorrow morning at a definite time , then s@@ ke@@ da@@ d@@ dle off to s@@ lee@@ p in good time the night before .
I believe that if one in ten Po@@ sti@@ me@@ es read@@ ers he@@ eded my advice , life in Estonia would get marke@@ dly better .
I myself plan to follow my own advice .
such attempts cap@@ ti@@ vate people .
it would be great if people took the time to think some more and draw conclusions .
the recommendation to investigate the background of people who want to be friends is an obvious one .
in general , everyone should have a strategy concerning what they share about themselves on social media .
at the state level , it should be asked whether officials and politicians are sufficiently well-@@ informed of the dangers lying on social media .
in controlled conditions , the lif@@ es@@ p@@ an of fa@@ ke accounts ended in summer school , but not those of the real E@@ vil@@ do@@ ers .
a fourth person from Estonia received a heart transplant in Finland .
according to heart sur@@ ge@@ on G@@ ü@@ n@@ ter Ta@@ al and car@@ di@@ olog@@ ist Pen@@ t@@ ti P@@ õ@@ der , North Estonia Me@@ di@@ cal Centre doctors who took part in the operation with Finnish medi@@ c@@ s , the post@@ oper@@ ative period has gone as expected .
&quot; it is very hard to say how long the patient would have lived without a new heart , &quot; said P@@ õ@@ der .
the doctors said people have now lived for a maximum of eight years with a heart pu@@ mp .
the patient himself is only reco@@ vering and is not ready to talk about the subject .
he was first diagno@@ sed with heart failure two years ago and the disease had already reached the end stage . the heart failure was caused by is@@ cha@@ em@@ ic heart disease .
&quot; for this patient , a transplant was the only option , &quot; added Ta@@ al .
the heart sur@@ ge@@ on said that after the transplant , the bat@@ teri@@ es or duct that are part of the heart pu@@ mp are no longer attached to the patient .
he will only have a s@@ car and anti-@@ rejection drugs .
the patient can play sports and generally live like an ordinary person , &quot; he said .
the first year is the most dangerous .
P@@ õ@@ der added that it would be three to six months until a full recovery .
both doctors said the patient would have to follow a strict drug reg@@ im@@ en , and the drugs have side effects .
in addition , the patient has to undergo exam@@ in@@ ations to avoid rejection of the donor organ .
the first year is the most dangerous , but according to IS@@ H@@ LT , the International Soci@@ ety for H@@ ear@@ t and L@@ ung Trans@@ plan@@ tation , already 50 % of patients are living more than ten years .
Ta@@ al said the results in Hel@@ sin@@ ki are better and the long@@ est anyone has lived with a trans@@ plan@@ ted heart is 25 years .
the car@@ di@@ a@@ c sur@@ ge@@ on explained that since the patient &apos;s circulation was poor because of the disease , he was f@@ itted with a heart pu@@ mp a year ago , which helped him grow stronger for the operation .
when the man &apos;s pul@@ mon@@ ary ar@@ terial pressure fell , he became a suitable candidate for a transplant .
the transplantation operation is not considered a very complicated sur@@ ger@@ y , Ta@@ al said : the right timing is very important .
&quot; it took much more time to get the pu@@ mp and then the heart , than placing the new heart in position , &quot; he said .
the heart sur@@ ge@@ on also noted that a complicated part of the operation was coming off external circulation .
he said , a heart transplant can be considered somewhat be considered extraordinary , as Est@@ on@@ i@@ ans need it the least .
kid@@ ne@@ y , li@@ ver and l@@ ung transplants are performed significantly more often .
there is an element of uncertainty in this rarely encountered operation , but we have been prac@@ tising this work for many years .
getting to know yourself and your ner@@ v@@ ous system is an art that is part of the profession , &quot; Ta@@ al added .
four more people need an organ .
Ta@@ al said the heart for the patient was obtained because it was@@ n &apos;t suitable for any other patient living in countries that are members of the S@@ can@@ di@@ at@@ r@@ ans@@ plant association .
S@@ can@@ di@@ at@@ r@@ ans@@ plant is an organ exchange organ@@ iz@@ ation whose members are Denmark , Finland , Iceland , Norway , Sweden and Estonia .
there are currently four more people on the heart transplant list in Estonia .
&quot; they are only a hand@@ ful of patients , &quot; P@@ õ@@ der stressed .
men with a large build and blood type O positive wait the long@@ est , said Ta@@ al .
&quot; in Finland , there is about a half year wait for this , &quot; he said .
there are also a number of conditions for getting a heart .
&quot; usually a woman &apos;s heart is not suitable , nor is a large person &apos;s heart suitable for a small person , and so on , &quot; said the car@@ di@@ o sur@@ ge@@ on .

compar@@ ing lo@@ d@@ ging establish@@ ments that offer sp@@ a options , it turns out that the prices of the cheap@@ est packages vary sever@@ al@@ fold and there are options for both more demanding customers and ho@@ li@@ da@@ yers with more modest preferences .
for example , while a single room for a sol@@ o travel@@ ler at V@@ ä@@ r@@ ska sp@@ a aqu@@ atic centre with bu@@ ff@@ et@@ -@@ style full board costs 51 euros , including unlimited use of the water par@@ k , weight room and sa@@ un@@ as , visiting P@@ ä@@ d@@ aste man@@ or on Mu@@ h@@ u Is@@ land will set one person back 2@@ 87 euros .
that includes accommodation in a D@@ ou@@ ble D@@ el@@ u@@ x@@ e category room , break@@ fast in the winter gar@@ den of the Alexander resta@@ ur@@ ant and a half-@@ day sp@@ a package called &quot; pe@@ el and mo@@ is@@ tu@@ ri@@ ze . &quot;
selec@@ ting and compar@@ ing different packages , one should take into account that to get the cheap@@ est price , one should go on holiday with a friend or compan@@ ion , because staying in a double room is cheaper than a single .
if one desi@@ res to holiday alone , in this case , depending on the place , gu@@ es@@ ts are offered special single rooms as well as double rooms with a single-@@ oc@@ cu@@ pan@@ cy supplement .
whereas generally a sol@@ o travel@@ ler will have to pay an additional fee of a couple do@@ zen euros for single oc@@ cu@@ pan@@ cy in a double room , there are cheaper options if one is willing to compromise .
for example , a package including a single room for one night at Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ u &apos;s F@@ R@@ A M@@ are T@@ hal@@ as@@ so sp@@ a costs 86 euros , but if desired , they also offer a low@@ er-@@ cost option of a double room on condition that if that there is limited space , someone else is accommo@@ dated in the same room as the custom@@ er , with advance notice .
in such a case , the price of the package is 58 euros .
to get a cheaper deal , it &apos;s a good idea to be flexible .
the prices of the packages are dynamic , meaning that they depend on the wee@@ k@@ day and va@@ can@@ cies .
&quot; prices can vary from 112 euros to 2@@ 48 euros in the case of the cheap@@ est package , &quot; said Tri@@ in@@ u T@@ er@@ as , sales and marketing director of the V sp@@ a Ho@@ tel in T@@ ar@@ tu , regarding their price policy .
she , too , drew attention to the fact that the prices vary at their ho@@ tels depending on oc@@ cu@@ pan@@ cy and added that in general customers get the cheap@@ est price if they book directly from their website or ask for an offer .
as the summer period is the bus@@ i@@ est for sp@@ as , it is wise to make timely holiday plans to avoid a situation where the desired spot is sold out .
for example , on the selected package comparison date of 11 August , P@@ ä@@ r@@ n@@ u Hed@@ on sp@@ a and str@@ and sp@@ a and conference ho@@ tel had only Su@@ i@@ tes and La@@ he@@ ma@@ a &apos;s Vi@@ h@@ ul@@ a man@@ or was sold out .
one need not go far to find places for a rela@@ xing holiday : nearly every larger town in Estonia has one or even several sp@@ as .
before buying a package , one should check whether there are@@ n &apos;t any major events ne@@ ar@@ by , because prices go through the ro@@ of then .
for example , the White Lady F@@ esti@@ val events take place in Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ u from 1@@ 1-@@ 13 August .
during this time , many tourists are in Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ u , demand for lo@@ d@@ ging is high and we have maj@@ or@@ -@@ event prices during this period .
&quot; thus we won &apos;t be selling dis@@ coun@@ ted or special offers on packages during this time , &quot; commen@@ ted the director of La@@ ine , I@@ ren@@ e v@@ ä@@ l@@ i .
&quot; flying American &quot; under a black sa@@ il
of course I &apos;@@ ve heard of &quot; flying &quot; ships .
who has@@ n &apos;t ?
H@@ y@@ dro@@ fo@@ ils go back and forth several times a day between T@@ all@@ in@@ n and Hel@@ sin@@ ki .
it &apos;s nothing special .
the Swiss company S@@ up@@ ram@@ ar launched the first fo@@ iling vessel , the F@@ rec@@ ci@@ a d &apos;@@ Or@@ o or G@@ ol@@ den ar@@ row , in 195@@ 2 .
the technology existed before that , but now there &apos;s a wind@@ -@@ powered vessel before me .
a ca@@ ta@@ mar@@ an , yes , yet still a sa@@ il@@ boat .
what formula makes it go air@@ borne ?
let &apos;s spare ourselves the formula ( it is@@ n &apos;t hard to find ) and take a la@@ y@@ man &apos;s gl@@ ance at the concept of fo@@ iling .
what keeps aero@@ planes al@@ of@@ t ?
the wing &apos;s shape is such that when the aircraft goes forward at high speed , the air flow@@ ing at different spe@@ eds below and above the wing creates aero@@ dynamic lift . at a certain point , it exceeds the plane &apos;s mass and the whole contra@@ ption becomes air@@ borne .
essentially the same process takes place in water .
a wing with the right shape creates lift as it moves along , and this in turn lif@@ ts the &quot; w@@ ing@@ ed &quot; vessel out of the water .
simple , right ?
it gets complicated when we get to the ma@@ the@@ ma@@ tical part .
an aero@@ plane needs a minimum speed of 15@@ 0-@@ 250 k@@ p@@ h to take off , and the world record for the speed of a sa@@ il@@ boat is currently &quot; only &quot; 12@@ 1.@@ 1 km / h .
but let &apos;s not get bo@@ gged down in high school physi@@ cs !
today we &apos;@@ ve come to look at a &quot; flying &quot; ca@@ ta@@ mar@@ an called the NA@@ C@@ RA@@ F@@ 20 Car@@ bon F@@ CS .
NA@@ CR@@ A is the ac@@ ron@@ y@@ m of &quot; North American ca@@ ta@@ mar@@ an ra@@ cing Association . &quot;
F@@ CS is an ab@@ b@@ revi@@ ation for F@@ light Control System .
it &apos;s a system that allows the cre@@ w to tri@@ m the vessel &apos;s set@@ t@@ ings in mid@@ - &quot; flight &quot; as well , and the 20 indicates the length of the sa@@ il@@ boat in feet .
as soon as the ca@@ ta@@ mar@@ an emer@@ ges from under the covers , it &apos;s clear this is@@ n &apos;t your Sunday driver &apos;s sa@@ il@@ boat .
D@@ r@@ . Mon@@ oc@@ le and Cap@@ tain V@@ el@@ v@@ et@@ vest remain on the Pi@@ er .
no room for Pi@@ i@@ p and Pri@@ l@@ li@@ d on board .
this here is hard@@ core .
this is speed C@@ u@@ bed .
&quot; is this made of carbon fib@@ re ? &quot; I ask , indicating the sa@@ il .
yes , it &apos;s all made of carbon fib@@ re .
&quot; the whole sa@@ il , then ? &quot; I ask , not quite com@@ pre@@ h@@ ending .
&quot; no , the whole boat , &quot; comes the ter@@ se answer .
170 k@@ g - the three of us embar@@ king surely weigh more than 170 k@@ g put together .
I compare everything - from deter@@ gent to afternoon s@@ n@@ ac@@ ks - to cars and this is no exception here - NA@@ CR@@ A F@@ 20 is like a ra@@ cer that &apos;s not street legal .
a P@@ ag@@ ani Z@@ on@@ da R or Fer@@ r@@ ari F@@ X@@ X .
built with a definite purpose in mind - to be driven in controlled conditions , and very , very fast .
sa@@ iling ho@@ b@@ by@@ ists would be f@@ lab@@ ber@@ gas@@ ted at the amount of safety equipment that has to be don@@ ned before putting out to sea .
W@@ et@@ suit , lin@@ er so@@ cks , special foot@@ wear with good tra@@ ction , sa@@ iling glo@@ ves , har@@ nesses , a special life vest , hel@@ met .
ar@@ ra@@ yed for battle , I feel that all I would need is an o@@ x@@ y@@ gen tan@@ k and I would be ready to go and coloni@@ ze M@@ ars , not just for putting out to sea .
&quot; so is there a high prob@@ ability of cap@@ siz@@ ing ? &quot; I ask in a jo@@ cular tone .
&quot; yes , &quot; comes the brief reply .
&quot; you &apos;@@ ve cap@@ sized a lot ? &quot; I continue pro@@ bing .
G@@ ot@@ ch@@ a - this is not going to be a wal@@ k in the par@@ k .
I fas@@ ten my seat b@@ el@@ t men@@ tally .
another thing that under@@ s@@ co@@ res the special nature of the cra@@ ft is that to go out to sea , the N@@ ac@@ ra F@@ 20 F@@ CS needs an au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary boat next to it and at least two cre@@ w members .
the maximum is three , so there is@@ n &apos;t a lot of lee@@ way .
it starts to da@@ wn on me why this is@@ n &apos;t just a Sunday cru@@ ise@@ r .
A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an cu@@ is@@ ine : from finger L@@ im@@ es to the school@@ yard .
contemporary A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an cu@@ is@@ ine in@@ heri@@ ted the finger li@@ me and k@@ an@@ ga@@ ro@@ o meat from the ab@@ original peoples .
the British roots have also had a great influence on the diet - for example , V@@ e@@ g@@ em@@ ite , the dark bro@@ wn , sal@@ ty Bre@@ wer &apos;s ye@@ ast spread that is s@@ me@@ ared on brea@@ d or cra@@ c@@ kers along with bu@@ tter is re@@ minis@@ cent of the British Mar@@ mi@@ te .

the A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an c@@ oo@@ king celeb@@ rity Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e Alexander and her life &apos;s work , the home che@@ f &apos;s bi@@ ble The C@@ oo@@ k &apos;s compan@@ ion , which can be found in at least half a million A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an homes . / B@@ la@@ ke sto@@ re@@ y , Prime C@@ rea@@ tive Me@@ dia
this autumn , Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e celeb@@ rates her 7@@ 7@@ th bir@@ th@@ day .
her father was a public ser@@ v@@ ant and her mother M@@ ary lo@@ ved food .
Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e studied libr@@ ary science in school and as is custom@@ ary for young A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ ans , after fin@@ ishing her studies she went off to discover Europe .
travelling in France only reinforced and developed her love for food .
in London , she met her first hus@@ band , Mon@@ ty , who had J@@ ama@@ ic@@ an roots , and when they returned to Australia , they opened a basic ea@@ tery in M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne in 196@@ 4 , the J@@ ama@@ ic@@ an House .
some ten years later , the marriage fell apart and the resta@@ ur@@ ant closed .
in 197@@ 6 , she opened a slightly more up@@ scale resta@@ ur@@ ant , Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e &apos;s , which was one of the most celebrated d@@ ining establish@@ ments in M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne for the next 21 years .
the semin@@ al resta@@ ur@@ ant is still remembered as the first fine d@@ ining establishment in M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne , which genuinely knew how to enhance the value fresh ingredients and served seasonal food - a fact that now seems like a basic a@@ xi@@ om but was far from standard at the end of the 20th century .
after leaving the resta@@ ur@@ ant business in 1997 , Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e has focused on writing c@@ oo@@ k@@ books , of which she has au@@ tho@@ red 15 .
Estonia has more pro@@ li@@ fic food wri@@ ters , but in her case , none of her books is just a collection of reci@@ pes .
for Australia &apos;s home c@@ oo@@ ks , the various c@@ oo@@ k@@ books by Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e Alexander are indispensable .
she herself considers her fifth c@@ oo@@ k@@ book , the extremely popular The C@@ oo@@ k &apos;s compan@@ ion , to be her life &apos;s work ; it is now in at least half a million A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an homes .
the book was first published in 1996 , and an updated edi@@ tion was published in 2004 . the new@@ est version is from 2014 .
the 2004 edi@@ tion takes up quite a bit of space on my boo@@ k@@ shel@@ f , as the imposing book has about 1@@ ,@@ 000 reci@@ pes on 1@@ ,@@ 12@@ 6 pages !
the new@@ est version is even more v@@ olu@@ min@@ ous .
Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e Alexander &apos;s mas@@ ter@@ piece : the C@@ oo@@ k &apos;s compan@@ ion is in at least half a million A@@ us@@ tr@@ ali@@ an homes . / A@@ my Pi@@ es@@ se
it &apos;s a true cul@@ in@@ ary bi@@ ble , which besides reci@@ pes also covers shopping and preservation of various ingredients , introduces food preparation technologies and provides recommendations for purchasing k@@ it@@ che@@ n ac@@ cess@@ or@@ ies .
the ingredients are listed in al@@ pha@@ be@@ tical order , and there are many cross-@@ references - it &apos;s clear that her libr@@ ari@@ an &apos;s training was not wasted .
Ste@@ p@@ han@@ i@@ e herself empha@@ siz@@ es that it was this book that changed her life and gave direction to her future activities .
the feeling she got from the book &apos;s popul@@ arity - that she had something to give people - led her to the next , k@@ it@@ che@@ n gar@@ den project , which in Est@@ onian conditions are comparable to school g@@ ard@@ ens .
R@@ as@@ mus M@@ ä@@ g@@ i : training has@@ n &apos;t gone exactly as I imag@@ ined it would
&quot; it has@@ n &apos;t been exactly as I imag@@ ined it , &quot; M@@ ä@@ g@@ i said regarding the training that prece@@ ded the world champi@@ on@@ ships .
Friday and Saturday are key moments that will show what shape his body is in exactly .
and the competition will reveal everything , so what point is there to analyse here .
right now , I feel that my training as been high in quality , both this year and in years past , so on the strength of all that , I can run pretty solid .
M@@ ä@@ g@@ i , who will start in preliminary hea@@ ts on Sunday at 13 : 05 Est@@ onian time , has@@ n &apos;t been up to much of anything since the domestic champi@@ on@@ ships .
people often over@@ do it in practice in the last weeks .
I should be fresh and it could work in my favour that the last week before the world champi@@ on@@ ships was a little ligh@@ ter .
in terms of the physical side , the days left until the start go like this : yesterday , the hur@@ d@@ ler res@@ ted , today he has a war@@ mu@@ p practice .
he do@@ es@@ n &apos;t want to del@@ ve too deep into his mental preparation : &quot; like anyone , I &apos;@@ ve developed my rou@@ tin@@ es over time .
there &apos;s a lot of peace and quiet and I don &apos;t let any ro@@ ck music into my e@@ ars .
I don &apos;t need to watch any motiva@@ tional vi@@ de@@ os or read self-@@ help books , but rather just be where I am and appreciate the fact at that moment that a@@ th@@ le@@ tes have gathered from around the world to see how they measure up to each other in terms of ability .
that alone makes it special .
the world champi@@ on@@ ships are naturally a top event of the year for track and field a@@ th@@ le@@ tes and M@@ ä@@ g@@ i has started every race in the past , including ra@@ ces in the Di@@ am@@ on@@ d League , as an experim@@ ent - tried out some technical nu@@ ance , p@@ itted himself against a competi@@ tor .
at the title champi@@ on@@ ships , there &apos;s no more possibility for experim@@ en@@ tation .
&quot; here the goal is just to run fast , &quot; says M@@ ä@@ g@@ i , but adds that if he manag@@ es to reserve even a percent or two of his energy in the preliminary heat and potential in the semi@@ -@@ final , that will definitely help him in the next race .
for the first time , the Centre Party is heading into elections without the party &apos;s foun@@ der and ideological cornerstone .
to this point , we said Centre Party and we meant Sa@@ v@@ isa@@ ar , or vice vers@@ a .
now the Centre Party has to find its way without him .
they will also have to manoeuvre between the party &apos;s col@@ our@@ ful , at times criminal and embarras@@ sing past and the expectations of Sa@@ v@@ isa@@ ar &apos;s supporters within the party and those of voters .
Sa@@ v@@ isa@@ ar &apos;s departure puts the Centre Party in the most complicated situation it has been in ide@@ ologically .
on the basis of political practice and ideology to this point , it might be said that the old r@@ hin@@ o is just out@@ fo@@ xing them .
a number of cards that were tru@@ mp@@ s before may not be re@@ ali@@ zed this time .
the populism card do@@ es@@ n &apos;t work for the Centre Party , because Sa@@ v@@ isa@@ ar can always promise more than the prime minister &apos;s party .
playing the Russian card has become more difficult because of the Centre Party &apos;s position in the government and also because here , too , we see how the so-called Sa@@ vin@@ o@@ va election coalition is stepping on the gas .
the victim card is already in Sa@@ v@@ isa@@ ar &apos;s po@@ cket because of the ongoing court case .
for the Centre Party , the P@@ op@@ ula@@ r Fron@@ t card and the card of the poor ac@@ cur@@ sed one is also gone .
the first is not of much value without its foun@@ der and the coalition partners in the government keep the second one from being played energe@@ tically .
yet one card may have even greater weight .
every recent election has confirmed that the parties who are able to ar@@ tic@@ ula@@ te the basic conflict of the elections and then fulfil it will be successful .
the basic conflict has always revol@@ ved around Sa@@ v@@ isa@@ ar himself .
if any party should have the idea of revi@@ ving this ever-@@ effective conflict , the C@@ en@@ ter Party &apos;s dec@@ k of cards is once again short one tru@@ mp ace .
what will the Centre Party be left with then ?
they still have a strong party machine and no@@ te@@ worthy resources .
there will enough ri@@ b@@ b@@ on-@@ cu@@ t@@ t@@ ings before the elections , too .
most of the sh@@ am@@ eless self-@@ promotion four years ago using taxpayer money has hopefully been re@@ paid by now .
the T@@ all@@ in@@ n city media still exists , but less part@@ is@@ an gu@@ er@@ ri@@ l@@ la journ@@ alism being prac@@ tised there these days .
besides that , the party has vote magne@@ ts .
their role this time will be to pull it out of the fire , as the image of ruling party is not sufficient to significantly moti@@ vate voters .
in the ideological scheme of things , J@@ ü@@ r@@ i Ra@@ ta@@ s will have to find his own way , as the journey with Sa@@ v@@ isa@@ ar@@ ism ended this week .
tal@@ ented perfor@@ mers at P@@ ä@@ r@@ n@@ u weekend : d@@ run@@ k man cli@@ mb@@ s into someone else &apos;s car to s@@ lee@@ p
yesterday evening at 3@@ am , police received a slightly unusual call .
namely , the ow@@ ner of an Au@@ di said that a male stran@@ ger got into his car at a filling station near Por@@ t Ar@@ tu@@ r shopping centre and fell as@@ lee@@ p there .
the police pat@@ ro@@ l that responded found the man , who was star@@ tled by the arrival of law enforcement .
the man had apparently become ti@@ red along his journey and found a spot in the back seat of a car of someone he di@@ d@@ n &apos;t know .
&quot; after being w@@ o@@ k@@ en by law enforcement , the man continued on his way , &quot; the West pre@@ f@@ ec@@ t said on F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k .
all &apos;s well that ends well !

the du@@ mb@@ est questions to ask a bar@@ tender .
Hu@@ ff@@ ing@@ ton Po@@ st reported on questions that bar@@ ten@@ ders get but wish they di@@ d@@ n &apos;t .
what drin@@ k do you make the best ?
some drin@@ ks do indeed have more ingredients than others , but the same skills and experience go into making them .
often bar@@ ten@@ ders interpret the question as &quot; W@@ hat &apos;s the e@@ asi@@ est or fas@@ test for you to make right now ? , &quot; which signals that the custom@@ er do@@ es@@ n &apos;t care what they drin@@ k , whether it is hard to make or not for the bar@@ tender .
what &apos;s your fav@@ ori@@ te drin@@ k to make ?
this question is also interpreted the same way : what co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il would be the e@@ asi@@ est to get from you right now .
that &apos;s not for the bar@@ keep to say ; the custom@@ er is the one who makes the decisions based on their wal@@ let .
instead , bar@@ ten@@ ders would like to hear the question whether there are any speci@@ als at the moment .
what &apos;s served here that &apos;s good ?
maybe there &apos;s a sincere desire to find out whether the ba@@ r stands out from others in some way , but this could be asked in a different way .
nor does a bar@@ tender have a c@@ lu@@ e what a custom@@ er might prefer .
can I get a drin@@ k that is@@ n &apos;t very swe@@ et ?
as in the previous case , there &apos;s a rule that bar@@ ten@@ ders are@@ n &apos;t up to speed with your tas@@ te and preferences and what is swe@@ et for one person might not be for another person .
however , he is ready to hear you out on what sorts of flav@@ ours the co@@ ck@@ ta@@ il you desire should have .
will this drin@@ k give me a hea@@ da@@ che / han@@ go@@ ver ?
a bar@@ tender is@@ n &apos;t a doctor or s@@ oo@@ th@@ sa@@ yer to be in a position to sole@@ m@@ n@@ ly promise anything like that .

Belgian authorities knew of eg@@ g contamination back in June
&quot; we knew back in early June that there were possible problems with the in@@ sec@@ tici@@ de fi@@ p@@ ron@@ il , &quot; said K@@ at@@ ri@@ en Stra@@ gi@@ er , the press representative of the authority responsible for food safety in Belgium , in an inter@@ view with the TV channel V@@ R@@ T .
we immediately started an investigation and talked about the matter with the prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office , as it could be fraud .
from there on , the investigation became classified .
we understand that people have questions about health and we will try to answer them , &quot; added Sta@@ gi@@ er .
in recent days , the news agency A@@ F@@ P tried to get information from the prosecu@@ tor dealing with the matter , but the prosecu@@ tor did not say anything as the judge in the investigation prohibited disclosure of information .
chic@@ ken eggs have been removed from shel@@ ves in Belgium as a precautionary measure until the test results come back .
millions of Dutch eggs have been removed from shel@@ ves in the Netherlands and Germany
German Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt has called for Dutch and Belgian officials to bring clarity to the matter quickly .
&quot; someone clearly crimin@@ ally contaminated the eggs with a prohibited product , &quot; Schmidt told German newspaper Bil@@ d .
according to Est@@ onian V@@ e@@ ter@@ in@@ ary and Food Board ( V@@ TA ) , none of the pesticide contaminated eggs produced in Netherlands are likely to be in Estonia .
&quot; our information is that there are no Dutch eggs in Estonia . &quot; V@@ TA spokes@@ man Martin Al@@ tra@@ ja told B@@ N@@ S .
he added that there are no other products produced from Dutch eggs in Estonia , either .
according to Sta@@ tis@@ tics Estonia , no eggs have been imported from Netherlands to Estonia in the last 10 years .
the last time eggs were imported from Netherlands was in 2006 .
Dutch authorities suspect that the pesticide fi@@ p@@ ron@@ il was introduced into chic@@ ken farms due to an attempt by the Dutch company Ch@@ ic@@ k@@ friend to treat chic@@ ken inf@@ es@@ ted with li@@ ce .
reports in Dutch and Belgian media that the p@@ es@@ tici@@ de-@@ containing substance reached Ch@@ ic@@ k@@ friend via a Belgian company are as yet un@@ confirmed .
according to the World Health Organization , fi@@ p@@ ron@@ il is moder@@ ately hazardous in larger quantities and can have negative effects on human kid@@ ne@@ ys , li@@ ver and th@@ y@@ ro@@ id , above all in children .
how to keep sex exc@@ iting when you &apos;@@ re trying to have children ?
it &apos;s thus very important to keep the passion burning even when you &apos;@@ re trying to bring a new life into the world .
female First gives some ti@@ ps on what course to take so that sex do@@ es@@ n &apos;t seem like a bo@@ ther@@ some duty .
don &apos;t see it as a responsibility .
this can happen to any couple trying to get pregnant .
sometimes it can take years to get pregnant .
sex on demand takes away spon@@ tan@@ e@@ ity and ro@@ man@@ ce .
try to be spon@@ tan@@ e@@ ous !
women often feel that they can &apos;t enjoy &quot; ordinary &quot; sex at the end of their cycle if they know there won &apos;t be a positive outcome .
this causes stra@@ in in the relationship , which may lead to less sex and less sex of course means an even greater prob@@ ability of not getting pregnant .
men on the other hand feel that they have to be able to &quot; perform &quot; on demand .
if you know your fer@@ tile days in advance , this can support you in planning something ro@@ man@@ tic with your swee@@ the@@ art .
it might be a special din@@ ner or just spending time together - enjoy one another !
take the fer@@ tile period into account .
from the reproductive standpoint , there &apos;s no point in having sex if o@@ v@@ u@@ lation has already occurred , but to get your relationship to blo@@ s@@ so@@ m , try to have sex just for pleasure on the non-@@ fer@@ tile days .
although there &apos;s no evidence that pregnancy is more certain if the woman has an or@@ g@@ as@@ m , still , don &apos;t forget that !
keep in mind that every couple is different .
everyone manag@@ es the stress of making a baby differently .
some men want to know about their partner &apos;s cycle , others prefer not to know , so that they w@@ oul@@ d@@ n &apos;t feel pressure to perform .
no one knows better than you what is right for you .
find your own solution !
studies have shown that couples who have sex every couple days have the best chance of success , but not every couple can maintain that frequency .
the most important thing is to find a pat@@ tern that is best for you as a couple .
10 under@@ handed advertising tri@@ cks that make food look more appe@@ ti@@ z@@ ing
as many foods are hard to photo@@ g@@ raph , pic@@ tures sometimes use some other ingredi@@ ent to f@@ ool people - for example , g@@ lu@@ e instead of milk or mas@@ hed po@@ ta@@ to@@ es instead of ice crea@@ m .
the Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be channel T@@ o@@ p tr@@ ending looks at what tri@@ cks are the most common in the advertising world .
if someone in a commercial opens a po@@ p@@ cor@@ n package or takes a h@@ amb@@ ur@@ ger out of a box , a bun@@ ch of attractive ste@@ am es@@ ca@@ pes from it .
in ac@@ tu@@ ality , the shot is longer and the hot food do@@ es@@ n &apos;t give off ste@@ am the whole time , as the ste@@ am comes from the high mo@@ is@@ ture content , which brea@@ d products for example don &apos;t have .
for this reason , little cotton b@@ alls so@@ ak@@ ed in water have been added to the packaging or food , with the capability of absor@@ bing and retaining its share of water .
when exposed directly to heat , they ste@@ am longer than a bur@@ ger or po@@ p@@ cor@@ n and the product is made to look as if it was f@@ res@@ h@@ ly prepared .
Mas@@ hed po@@ ta@@ to@@ es are a big help for photo@@ graph@@ ers as they do@@ es@@ n &apos;t start mel@@ ting when exposed to heat or light and do@@ es@@ n &apos;t change consistency significantly like many other foodstuffs .
for example , a cre@@ am@@ y filling in a ca@@ ke or ic@@ e-@@ cold seem@@ ing ice crea@@ m may actually be mas@@ hed po@@ ta@@ to@@ es .
a little colour and dec@@ or@@ ative elements and the consumer is foo@@ led .
g@@ lu@@ e fil@@ ls in for milk .
milk is not easy to photo@@ g@@ raph either , because it do@@ es@@ n &apos;t necessarily look so white on a photo@@ g@@ raph .
and foods served in milk quickly become mus@@ h@@ y .
since break@@ fast cereal or mu@@ es@@ li has to look cris@@ p and ta@@ st@@ y in milk , g@@ lu@@ e is used instead - not a single fla@@ ke will sin@@ k through it .
resta@@ ur@@ ants often go to great len@@ g@@ ths in preparing meat so that the result would be ju@@ ic@@ y and done to perfec@@ tion , but not so in advertising .
yet meat displayed in advertise@@ ments seems especially temp@@ ting , like if it &apos;s just off the gri@@ ll .
often it is pre-@@ fri@@ ed on a p@@ an or ro@@ as@@ ted in an o@@ ven and then stri@@ pes are pain@@ ted on it in im@@ itation of gri@@ ll marks .
working with wh@@ i@@ pped crea@@ m is just as complicated as with ice crea@@ m , because it ten@@ ds to me@@ l@@ t .
lu@@ ck@@ ily there &apos;s a product that is nearly identical to wh@@ i@@ pped crea@@ m in appearance - s@@ having crea@@ m .
thus it may actually be s@@ having crea@@ m that &apos;s on top of the ca@@ ke or ber@@ ries or in the mil@@ ks@@ ha@@ ke in the ad .
even fruit sold in super@@ markets may be co@@ ated with a th@@ in la@@ yer of wa@@ x to make them look sh@@ in@@ i@@ er .
for a photo@@ g@@ raph , it &apos;s not enough , though , and so de@@ o@@ dor@@ ant is s@@ pra@@ yed on instead to add sh@@ ine to the fruit .
likewise , sa@@ u@@ ces are@@ n &apos;t that photo@@ genic , because over time they become run@@ ny or they separate .
this is where wa@@ x comes to the rescue , as its b@@ right col@@ ours and more stable tex@@ ture make it possible to take an appe@@ ti@@ z@@ ing picture .
wa@@ x is likely to be used on pic@@ tures that show m@@ ol@@ ten cho@@ col@@ ate flow@@ ing over ca@@ ke or ice crea@@ m .
if you see an ideal sli@@ ce of ca@@ ke in a picture , with the ideal proportion of spon@@ ge ca@@ ke to filling , probably some additional la@@ yers or pieces of car@@ d@@ board have been used .
that &apos;s because filling ten@@ ds to spread out and ru@@ in the picture when the ca@@ ke is cut .
if pieces of car@@ d@@ board are inser@@ ted into the ca@@ ke after cutting and s@@ pra@@ yed with filling , it leaves a vis@@ u@@ ally more attractive impression .
car@@ d@@ board and safety p@@ ins are used inside the bur@@ ger so that all ingredients are put in place so they would stay nic@@ ely in place .
that is a bur@@ ger served at a resta@@ ur@@ ant never looks like it does in an ad .
chic@@ ken stu@@ ff@@ ed with paper .
in an ad , a ro@@ ast chic@@ ken looks ju@@ ic@@ y and plu@@ mp , but it may not even be c@@ oo@@ ked through .
to leave the impression of plu@@ mp@@ ness , the chic@@ ken is stu@@ ff@@ ed with paper , and if necessary it is s@@ m@@ oo@@ th@@ ed with the mas@@ hed po@@ ta@@ to@@ es beforehand and then s@@ pra@@ yed all over with bro@@ wn pa@@ int .
pan@@ ca@@ kes are dou@@ sed with ma@@ ple sy@@ ru@@ ps especially in A@@ mer@@ can ads , because that makes people h@@ ung@@ ry for pan@@ ca@@ kes .
actually , pan@@ ca@@ kes absor@@ b sy@@ ru@@ p and the flow@@ ing ri@@ v@@ u@@ le@@ ts of sy@@ ru@@ p disappear quickly before the photo@@ g@@ rap@@ her can capture them .
that is why each Pan@@ ca@@ ke is s@@ pra@@ yed with a clean@@ ing product meant for sof@@ a cus@@ hi@@ ons , to avoid rapid absorption .
often this is not enough and thus gol@@ den@@ -@@ bro@@ wn engine oil is used , p@@ oured over hot pan@@ ca@@ kes and passed off as sy@@ ru@@ p .
Est@@ onian U@@ 18 team conce@@ des defeat to Great Britain and won &apos;t make it into division A
the game started at an extremely fast pace and a number of bas@@ kets were s@@ co@@ red in the first quarter , at the end of which the Bri@@ ts led by five , 2@@ 3-@@ 18 .
in the second quarter , the lead gre@@ w and the visitors went up by nine , 4@@ 0-@@ 31 .
the Est@@ on@@ i@@ ans managed to outs@@ core the opponents in the third quarter but only by one point .
the Est@@ on@@ i@@ ans were down by eight ( 5@@ 4-@@ 46 ) going into the final ten minutes .
in the fourth quarter , the Est@@ on@@ i@@ ans &quot; game broke down completely and they had to settle for a 7@@ 5-@@ 61 loss .
the loss d@@ as@@ hed the Est@@ onian &quot; hopes of making it into division A , where only the two best teams advance .

the regional heads of the Centre Party from all over Estonia issued an appeal to the public and fellow party members calling them to vote for the Centre Party , not election co@@ ali@@ tions .

Ra@@ ta@@ s in response to An@@ si@@ p : we have done a great deal for Estonia &apos;s success .
vice President of the European Commission And@@ r@@ us An@@ si@@ p said in an inter@@ view with K@@ ro@@ on@@ ika that everyday Est@@ onian politics were sad to look at for him , as the J@@ ü@@ r@@ i Ra@@ ta@@ s government has turned a simple , predictable taxation system up@@ side down .
you took the opportunity to ask me in K@@ ro@@ on@@ ika ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine what I have done for Estonia &apos;s success and what I can feel proud of .
it &apos;s gra@@ ti@@ fying for me that we &apos;@@ re in government as a good team and that in just a few months we have made many important decisions . Estonia has been waiting for many of them for over ten years , &quot; Ra@@ ta@@ s wrote on social media .
Ra@@ ta@@ s said the decisions include income tax reform for raising people &apos;s income , pension reform for ensuring the elderly a respec@@ table pension age , local government reform for balancing Est@@ onian development , a rise in agricultural subsidies to stimulate rural life and naturally healthcare reform for offering available and high quality medical care .

good to know : how to calcu@@ late the amount of sugar in dairy products ?
&quot; under European Union food labelling standards , the amount of car@@ b@@ oh@@ y@@ dra@@ tes and su@@ g@@ ars can be listed on the packaging , which is not however equal to the amount of ordinary white table sugar , &quot; said V@@ ali@@ o Estonia marketing director K@@ ris@@ ta Kal@@ b@@ in .
she said there are actually three types of su@@ g@@ ars in dairy products : the la@@ c@@ to@@ se in milk - natural milk sugar - the g@@ lu@@ co@@ se and fru@@ c@@ to@@ se in fruit - and added sugar , suc@@ rose .
if one re@@ members a few basic tru@@ ths , Kal@@ b@@ in says , it shoul@@ d@@ n &apos;t be difficult to calcu@@ late the quantity of added sugar in a product .
first of all , find out whether it is a milk or fer@@ mented milk product .
ordinary milk and mil@@ k@@ -based be@@ ver@@ ages contain about 5 grams of natural la@@ c@@ to@@ se per 100 g of product .
in fer@@ mented milk products , part of the la@@ c@@ to@@ se has been used up by yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t or ke@@ f@@ ir bac@@ teri@@ a as a result of which fer@@ mented milk products have an average of 3.5 g of la@@ c@@ to@@ se per 100 g of product .
&quot; to calcu@@ late the quantity of added sugar , the first thing you have to do is sub@@ tra@@ ct the la@@ c@@ to@@ se from the sugar quantity , &quot; said Kal@@ b@@ in .
now the fru@@ c@@ to@@ se and g@@ lu@@ co@@ se from ber@@ ries and other fruit must be sub@@ tracted from the su@@ g@@ ars .
&quot; in general , flav@@ oured dairy products contain about of 0.@@ 3 g of fru@@ c@@ to@@ se and g@@ lu@@ co@@ se in the case of the ordinary 3-@@ 4 % fruit content and in the case of especially ber@@ r@@ y-@@ rich products with approximately 15 % fruit content , up to 1.5 grams per 100 grams , &quot; said Kal@@ b@@ in .
she says the simple calculation shows that the percentage of added sugar in Ber@@ ry yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ ts may be only half of the quantity of sugar marked on the package .
in the case of la@@ c@@ to@@ se@@ -free products , the situation is a bit different as the sugar content depends on the production technology .
10@@ 1-@@ year-old man sk@@ y@@ di@@ ves
world War II ve@@ te@@ ra@@ n Ver@@ du@@ n Ha@@ yes recently received a military dec@@ oration to commemor@@ ate his sk@@ y@@ di@@ ve , which broke a world record .
at the age of 10@@ 1 years and 38 days , the man performed a fe@@ at that made him the world &apos;s oldest person to perform a par@@ ac@@ hu@@ te ju@@ mp .
awaiting the evening dis@@ cus throw final : will Ger@@ d K@@ an@@ ter make world champi@@ on@@ ship history ?
the current World Ch@@ am@@ pi@@ on@@ ships are K@@ an@@ ter &apos;s eigh@@ th , and none of his competitors in London have at@@ tained such an accomplis@@ h@@ ment .
besides that , K@@ an@@ ter is the only dis@@ cus thro@@ wer in history to have won the complete me@@ dal cycle ( a gold , two sil@@ vers and two b@@ ron@@ z@@ es ) at the World Ch@@ am@@ pi@@ on@@ ships .
as of today ( 5 August 201@@ 7 ) K@@ an@@ ter is 38 years and 92 days old .
should the Est@@ onian hur@@ l himself into a two-@@ time world champion , he would be the oldest dis@@ cus thro@@ wer to have won a gold at the world champi@@ on@@ ships .
the Polish her@@ o P@@ j@@ ot@@ r Mal@@ ac@@ ho@@ wski has the same opportunity ( he is 34 years and 60 days old ) .
some more exc@@ iting facts :
a@@ th@@ le@@ tes from only two countries have become world champi@@ ons more than once .
Germany has nine gold med@@ als , Lithuania has two .
the world champi@@ on@@ ship record belongs to V@@ ir@@ gi@@ li@@ ju@@ s A@@ le@@ k@@ na , which was the 7@@ 0.@@ 17 hur@@ led in Hel@@ sin@@ ki ( 2005 ) .
the shor@@ test throw that won a title is 6@@ 6.@@ 20 - R@@ ie@@ del managed this ( in 199@@ 1 ) .
why do do@@ gs ni@@ b@@ ble on gras@@ s ?
sometimes it &apos;s believed that do@@ gs eat gras@@ s when they don &apos;t feel well and want to make themselves throw up .
actually , most do@@ gs that eat gras@@ s are totally healthy .
only less than 10 percent of do@@ gs who eat gras@@ s do so because of some illness .
one reason that a do@@ g might suddenly start eating gras@@ s could be a nutri@@ en@@ t-@@ poor diet .
do@@ gs with wor@@ ms also may have a greater interest in ch@@ om@@ ping on gras@@ s .
thus , if a do@@ g who has@@ n &apos;t che@@ wed on gras@@ s before suddenly starts doing so frequently , it would be a good idea to get it checked by a ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ an to quickly diagno@@ se any possible problems with dig@@ es@@ tive organs .
it should be mentioned that do@@ gs may also eat gras@@ s because they like the tas@@ te or out of bo@@ re@@ dom .
if a health problem is ruled out , one should make sure that the family pet has enough fulfilling and fu@@ n activities in its life .
police takes over 200 people down to the station during weekend F@@ esti@@ val .
in total , over 20 crimes were reported in the city of P@@ ä@@ r@@ n@@ u during the days of the f@@ esti@@ val .
about half of them can be linked to the music f@@ esti@@ val , besides violent crime , a large number of drug possession charges and two d@@ run@@ k driving charges were registered .
about a hundred of the mis@@ de@@ me@@ an@@ our proceedings opened were related to ju@@ ven@@ ile use or possession of alcohol or banned substances .
a couple the@@ f@@ ts and disturbing the peace charges were also recorded .
law enforcement took over 200 people to the station for various reasons .
of them , about 50 were ju@@ ven@@ i@@ les and the pre@@ dominant reason for a trip to the station was d@@ run@@ k@@ en@@ ness .
last year there were 50 % more ju@@ ven@@ i@@ les taken to the station .
about 50 people - as many as last year - were taken to so@@ ber up .
P@@ ä@@ r@@ n@@ u police prec@@ inc@@ t head And@@ res S@@ in@@ im@@ eri said the above figures were as expected considering the large crow@@ d .
as in years past , we made thorough preparations for the weekend this year .
we involved additional forces from other pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , police ca@@ de@@ ts and assis@@ tant poli@@ ce@@ men to ensure readiness to respond rapidly .
most situations were resolved ver@@ b@@ ally and communication between law enforcement and the citizens was enough .
&quot; some wrong@@ doing probably ended up being prevented , because the police presence was quite visible and pal@@ p@@ able in the city , in our opinion , &quot; said S@@ in@@ im@@ eri .
in his opinion , it was extremely positive that there were so many fewer ju@@ ven@@ i@@ les who had visi@@ bly used alcohol and the young people proved that one could party even while so@@ ber .
he pra@@ ised the security company &apos;s top@@ -@@ c@@ ali@@ b@@ re team , who took care of security in the f@@ esti@@ val area .
I thank all of the f@@ esti@@ val@@ go@@ ers who beha@@ ved in a respec@@ table manner and celebrated in a safe way .
&quot; I also thank local residents who with their understanding attitudes contributed to making a major f@@ esti@@ val a success , &quot; the police chief said .
lost articles found over the weekend in the city and f@@ esti@@ val grounds await their owners at P@@ ä@@ r@@ n@@ u police prec@@ inc@@ t .
the head of the P@@ ä@@ r@@ n@@ u service responsible for return of lost and found objects , An@@ n@@ ika P@@ ä@@ r@@ na , said there were fewer items in the lost &amp; found than last year .
over half of the items were returned to their owners on a running basis in the police tent on the f@@ esti@@ val grounds .
the items most frequently lost over the three days were bank cards , identity documents , cel@@ l phones and ke@@ ys .
&quot; there are another 13 cel@@ l phones , three w@@ alle@@ ts , a lap@@ top , a smart watch and several sets of car ke@@ ys still awaiting their owners at the station , &quot; said P@@ ä@@ r@@ na .

before turning himself in , according to a Ch@@ ic@@ ago police worker , La@@ them sent a video to friends and family members in which he talks about making his biggest mistake .

Sou@@ th@@ west Japan bra@@ ces for Ty@@ pho@@ on Nor@@ u
a wide s@@ wa@@ the of sou@@ th@@ west Japan , including areas devastated by tor@@ ren@@ tial ra@@ ins last month , on Friday bra@@ ced for more rain as Ty@@ pho@@ on Nor@@ u , at one point the world &apos;s strongest storm this year , ch@@ ur@@ ned closer to the country &apos;s main islands .
the A@@ m@@ am@@ i island chain , located just south of the sou@@ th@@ west main island of Ky@@ us@@ h@@ u and some 1@@ ,@@ 350 km ( 8@@ 40 mi@@ les ) from T@@ o@@ k@@ y@@ o , will be hit by high wind@@ s and heavy ra@@ ins from noon on Friday , with as much as 800 m@@ m ( 31 in@@ ches ) possible in the next 48 hours , the Me@@ te@@ o@@ ro@@ logical Agency said .
Nor@@ u - which is a Korean word for a type of de@@ er - is then likely to turn north and d@@ ren@@ ch Ky@@ us@@ h@@ u , although the northern parts of the island , which last month were hit with tor@@ ren@@ tial ra@@ ins and flooding that killed 36 and left four missing , are likely to be s@@ pared the worst , an agency spokes@@ man said .
&quot; this is an extremely s@@ low-@@ moving storm , &quot; he added , noting this means there is a higher danger of floods due to extended heavy ra@@ ins in one area .
Nor@@ u , at one point a Ca@@ te@@ g@@ ory 5 ty@@ pho@@ on and an un@@ usually long-@@ lived storm , first formed two weeks ago and wan@@ dered in a circle around the northern Pacific before heading nor@@ th@@ west and aiming for Japan , weakening as it approached .
depending on how its course changes , Nor@@ u could also ra@@ k@@ e straight across Ky@@ us@@ h@@ u and then along Japan &apos;s main island of H@@ on@@ sh@@ u , but long@@ er@@ -term movements are still hard to p@@ in down , the spokes@@ man added .
plane tra@@ ces perfect outline of itself over the US
a pilot has taken a passenger j@@ et on a z@@ ig@@ za@@ g cross-@@ country flight over the US - and even managed to have some fu@@ n with the route .

former sol@@ di@@ er ja@@ iled for m@@ ur@@ dering O@@ A@@ P suspected of sex abuse
a former sol@@ di@@ er has been ja@@ iled for a minimum of 17 years for m@@ ur@@ dering a man he believed had abused a woman he knew .
Richard Cas@@ si@@ d@@ y , 70 , was found guilty at the High Court in G@@ las@@ go@@ w in June of the murder of David Far@@ ish , 75 , at his home in T@@ we@@ ed@@ bank , Ro@@ x@@ bur@@ gh@@ shire , in February 201@@ 6 .
judge L@@ ord sum@@ mers described the murder as &quot; particularly brutal , &quot; with 14 sta@@ b w@@ ounds inf@@ licted on the victim .
defence lawyer Brian Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ac@@ hi@@ e Q@@ C said the killing was a &quot; moment of ma@@ dness &quot; but he described the circumstances as &quot; unique . &quot;
Cas@@ si@@ d@@ y had been told Mr Far@@ ish had sexu@@ ally abused a woman over a long period .
his lawyer said he went to Mr Far@@ ish &apos;s home and &quot; be@@ fri@@ ended &quot; him in the hope of hearing a conf@@ es@@ sion rather than planning to kill him .
L@@ ord sum@@ mers said Cas@@ si@@ d@@ y showed pre@@ medi@@ tation on the day of the attack and referred to a social work report that found he had received Special For@@ ces training while in the Ar@@ my on how to inf@@ il@@ tra@@ te groups by be@@ fri@@ ending them .
no charges had been brought against Mr Far@@ ish .
the court heard that , after the murder , Cas@@ si@@ d@@ y conta@@ cted police and handed himself in .
Mr Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ac@@ hi@@ e said most people found it &quot; hard to understand &quot; that Cas@@ si@@ d@@ y would be capable of murder .
the defence lawyer said : &quot; he had never been in trouble in his life before this incident .
he lived a fulfilling life until what he describes as a moment of ma@@ dness in February 201@@ 6 . &quot;
Cas@@ si@@ d@@ y is said to be in poor health and has suffered a heart attack and stro@@ ke while in custo@@ dy .
L@@ ord sum@@ mers said he took into account Cas@@ si@@ d@@ y &apos;s lack of previous convictions and what he had re@@ por@@ te@@ dly been told about Mr Far@@ ish as he passed a life sentence with a minimum term of 17 years in ja@@ il .
police Scotland described the case as a &quot; particularly he@@ in@@ ous murder of a fra@@ il , elderly man in his own home . &quot;
De@@ te@@ ctive In@@ spec@@ tor David P@@ in@@ kne@@ y said : &quot; although this sentence will not reverse his cruel actions , I do hope it will bring some measure of resolution for David &apos;s family . &quot;
as part of a t@@ our of the smaller islands , today Prime Minister J@@ ü@@ r@@ i Ra@@ ta@@ s visited Estonia &apos;s fourth largest island , V@@ or@@ m@@ si , where he met local m@@ un@@ ici@@ pal@@ ity leaders and residents to discuss topical issues in regard to life on the island .
the t@@ our of V@@ or@@ m@@ si Is@@ land started in S@@ vi@@ by har@@ b@@ our , where Prime Minister Ra@@ ta@@ s was met by V@@ or@@ m@@ si m@@ un@@ ici@@ pal@@ ity may@@ or Tan@@ el V@@ i@@ ks and chairman of the m@@ un@@ ici@@ pal@@ ity coun@@ cil , I@@ vo Sar@@ a@@ pu@@ u .
they first visited historical S@@ t@@ . O@@ la@@ v &apos;s Church and the ad@@ jac@@ ent ce@@ me@@ tery , unique in Estonia for its li@@ mes@@ tone and s@@ and@@ stone circle cro@@ s@@ ses .
it was followed by a visit to V@@ or@@ m@@ si nur@@ ser@@ y and B@@ asi@@ c Sch@@ ool where director A@@ ge H@@ ä@@ l@@ v@@ in conver@@ sed with the prime minister about the school &apos;s way of life and the organ@@ iz@@ ation of study , where some of the school pupils are en@@ rol@@ led online .
in the morning , the prime minister visited the new and modern operational services centre building opened in 2015 , where a meeting with is@@ land@@ ers also took place .
at the discussion , key topics for the residents were covered , such as the development of shipping and aviation routes between smaller islands and the main@@ land .
the state has taken the obligation to ensure regular transport links for permanently settled small islands , but increased traffic in the summer period , for example , makes it more difficult for local people when they have important travel .
these are areas where the state can take the wishes and needs of the lo@@ c@@ als into account early on , and in the planning process , &quot; said the prime minister .
in addition , the issues of the construction of a Mar@@ ina , ho@@ b@@ by education , safety on the island and rescue capability were discussed .
today &apos;s V@@ or@@ m@@ si visit was the last stop on the prime minister &apos;s t@@ our of the small islands , in order to get acqu@@ ain@@ ted with the living environment on the islands and to discuss issues awaiting a solution with local inhabitants and m@@ un@@ ici@@ pal@@ ity leaders .

U@@ 18 team head coach Va@@ id@@ o Re@@ go : a pla@@ yo@@ ff game can be decided by one or two bas@@ kets
Estonia &apos;s under 18 age category bas@@ k@@ et@@ ball team defe@@ ated Poland 6@@ 8-@@ 63 in the European champi@@ on@@ ships division B quar@@ ter@@ final . the head coach said it was a ol@@ d-@@ school pla@@ yo@@ ff meeting .
it was@@ n &apos;t a pretty game .
both teams had done their home@@ work , and the points di@@ d@@ n &apos;t come easily .
the issue of who had the better ner@@ ves came into play .
a pla@@ yo@@ ff game can indeed come down to one or two bas@@ kets , &quot; Re@@ go mu@@ sed .
while it was a victory , the first thing a coach looks for is what can be improved .
one can always find something to g@@ rum@@ ble about .
we committed some bad f@@ ou@@ ls , our op@@ pon@@ ent got easy free thro@@ ws and lived off of them .
that &apos;s happened before for us - when you start defending agg@@ res@@ si@@ vely there &apos;s the danger of trying too hard .
we &apos;@@ ll draw our conclusions , &quot; said Re@@ go .
he used nine players today . R@@ ob@@ in K@@ iv@@ i , who missed a couple games due to inju@@ ry , was still on the ben@@ ch
these decisions are made on a running basis .
K@@ iv@@ i participated in the morning practice and pre@@ game war@@ m@@ -up , but he was@@ n &apos;t hundred percent ready , &quot; explained the coach .
tomorrow at 18@@ 15 Estonia will meet Great Britain in the semi@@ final , who be@@ at Bulgaria today , 76 to 73 .
the winner of this game will play in division A of the European champi@@ on@@ ships in the U@@ 18 age class next summer .
woman finds unknown person &apos;s we@@ d@@ ding ring in was@@ hing machine - who could it belong to ?
&quot; I started taking the clo@@ th@@ es out of the was@@ her when I saw something g@@ lin@@ ting between the rub@@ ber seal of the was@@ hing machine , &quot; said the woman about how she found an unknown person &apos;s we@@ d@@ ding ring in her was@@ hing machine .
actually , Kar@@ in di@@ d@@ n &apos;t really investigate the sh@@ in@@ y object in the door of the was@@ hing machine at first .
I turned on the was@@ hing machine again .
&quot; two young children produce a lot of di@@ r@@ ty la@@ un@@ d@@ ry , &quot; the woman c@@ hu@@ ck@@ les .
when the next cycle ended and I started taking the was@@ h out , the g@@ lin@@ t between the rub@@ ber seal the was@@ hing machine caught my eye and that &apos;s when I found the ring .
en@@ gra@@ ved on the gold we@@ d@@ ding ring was the name of a man who had got mar@@ ried 14 years ago - Tom@@ i .
as there was@@ n &apos;t anyone in the family by that name , man or woman , who might be mar@@ ried to Tom@@ i , the ring is a total my@@ ster@@ y .
Kar@@ in asked her oldest child whether perhaps she had found the ring outside , put it in her po@@ cket , after which the ring ended up in the was@@ hing machine at some point , but the da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter said that she ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t brought any r@@ ings home .
Kar@@ in has been living with her partner in an a@@ part@@ ment in T@@ all@@ in@@ n for a year now .
before that they ren@@ ted it out and the was@@ hing machine is from that time as well .
but if the ring was somehow connected to the ten@@ ants , how did it end up in the machine ?
&quot; now I &apos;@@ m ba@@ ff@@ led and I don &apos;t understand how the ring w@@ ound up in the was@@ hing machine , &quot; the woman laugh@@ s .
because her life is quite fast-@@ pac@@ ed with her two young children , the ring lay on a cu@@ p@@ board for a while , forgotten .
&quot; recently there have been posts where someone is looking for the ow@@ ner of a we@@ d@@ ding ring , and now it seemed that it was high time to look for the ow@@ ner of the ring that I found , &quot; says Kar@@ in referring to an case on social media where a we@@ d@@ ding ring found on P@@ u@@ han@@ g@@ u T@@ Ä@@ NA@@ V in T@@ all@@ in@@ n was happily re@@ united with its ow@@ ner last week .
&quot; as various items are reported lost and found on F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k , I thought I would try my luck there first , &quot; said Kar@@ in , whose post has been shared by close to 4@@ ,@@ 000 people already .
&quot; the post has received all kinds of feedback , not all of it good , &quot; si@@ gh@@ s Kar@@ in , saying that the first comments recommended that she take her hus@@ band to task .
at that point , I had the feeling of , do I need this cra@@ p right now .
that my hus@@ band has become the biggest c@@ hea@@ ter anyone &apos;s heard of .
to be honest , it had me worried at first , but later , when other comments suggested that maybe I had been up to mon@@ key business with the ow@@ ner of the ring , that made me lau@@ gh .
some commen@@ ters also suggested the idea that perhaps the ring had been in the po@@ cket of second-@@ hand clothing .
&quot; well , about six months ago , I did buy some second-@@ hand sla@@ cks that I can wear to work , which I thre@@ w in the was@@ hing machine without examining them carefully , but really ? &quot; the woman mu@@ ses to herself .
be that as it may , but I agreed with my partner that we have to find the ow@@ ner of the ring now as a matter of principle .
whatever the reason for the disappearance of the ring .
divorce , domestic stri@@ fe , or whatever .
I think that &apos;s the right thing to do . because if I should ever lose my we@@ d@@ ding ring , I know I would be totally grateful to a person who tried to find me and return my valuable possession .
Kar@@ in has also turned to the vital statistics office for help in finding the person .
I got the response that no gentle@@ man by that name got mar@@ ried on that day in Estonia .
one ring has found its ow@@ ner
recently the we@@ d@@ ding ring found on 21 July in the P@@ el@@ gu@@ lin@@ n part of T@@ all@@ in@@ n was happily re@@ united with its ow@@ ner as the en@@ gra@@ ving gave reason to believe that it bel@@ on@@ ged to an elderly woman .
&quot; I was wal@@ king my do@@ g in the morning when I noticed a gol@@ den ring behind the building at P@@ u@@ han@@ g@@ u 53 in a well-@@ tro@@ d@@ den di@@ r@@ t path , &quot; says Ger@@ li . the en@@ gra@@ ving gave reason to believe that it bel@@ on@@ ged to an elderly woman .
Ger@@ li posted a photo@@ g@@ raph of the ring ( pic@@ tured ) on her F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k page and in the group M@@ ä@@ r@@ ga@@ tu@@ d T@@ all@@ in@@ n@@ as ( seen in T@@ all@@ in@@ n ) , and shared the information with the Nor@@ th-@@ T@@ all@@ in@@ n distri@@ ct and the Northern P@@ ref@@ ec@@ ture .
two weeks later the police conta@@ cted her and noti@@ fied her that the ring we@@ are@@ r had been identified .
&quot; I conta@@ cted the da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter of the ow@@ ner and on Monday evening I handed the ring to the da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter . &quot; the r@@ ings had been lost because the older woman had injured her hand and put the ring on her other finger , and it then sli@@ pped off .
&quot; she lost it on the morning of the same day that I was wal@@ king my do@@ g , &quot; says Ger@@ li .
from time to time , you have to head to the w@@ oods , for whatever reason .
when the chil@@ l gets under your sk@@ in , it &apos;s time to make a hot te@@ a drin@@ k .
in the w@@ oods , you &apos;@@ ll find more than what you need for it .
Ka@@ it@@ se Ko@@ d@@ u ! provides a brief overview .
we talk about te@@ a drin@@ ks because co@@ ff@@ e@@ e and real te@@ a contain ca@@ ff@@ e@@ ine , which has a stimulating effect to some degree , but is@@ n &apos;t the best for our health .
when using plants found in the wild , you have to always be ready to experim@@ en@@ tation , because reci@@ pes and flav@@ ours are different
some plants don &apos;t have to be bo@@ iled long ; it &apos;s enough to p@@ our hot water on them , while others have to be in@@ fu@@ sed for hours .
naturally , you have to make sure the water and plants are sufficiently clean and pure .
much depends on the gathering season and place , too .
we &apos;@@ ll now take a closer look at how to make simple te@@ a drin@@ ks and what effect they might have on us .
p@@ ine need@@ le te@@ a
p@@ ine need@@ le te@@ a can be consumed to your heart &apos;s content ye@@ ar-@@ round .
if it &apos;s good to drin@@ k 2 lit@@ res of water a day , the te@@ a is also suitable for satis@@ fying vita@@ m@@ in C requirements and also giving a little extra energy .
as in the case of all plants , alternative methods can be used for extra@@ cting beneficial elements from p@@ ine need@@ les , such as by c@@ rus@@ hing them - the need@@ les don &apos;t have to be bo@@ iled long and it is enough to p@@ our hot water over them and let them ste@@ e@@ p for a few hours .
use 0.@@ 4 li@@ tre of need@@ les per half li@@ tre of water , and bo@@ il for 15 minutes .
the result is a drin@@ k that contains close to 25 m@@ g of vita@@ m@@ in C , much po@@ tas@@ si@@ um and z@@ in@@ c .
in addition , the drin@@ k also contains about 1.5 sugar cu@@ bes &quot; worth - 20 cal@@ or@@ ies - of sugar .
le@@ m@@ on and honey can always be added to improve the flav@@ our of the te@@ a .
and if the drin@@ k came out very strong , it can be d@@ il@@ u@@ ted with water like a sy@@ ru@@ p .
sp@@ ru@@ ce need@@ le te@@ a can be made the same way , but it tas@@ tes a little different .
ras@@ p@@ ber@@ ry drin@@ k is great and helps against many il@@ ls , from r@@ he@@ u@@ matism to ac@@ ne .
ras@@ p@@ ber@@ ry helps overcome fa@@ ti@@ gue , has a pa@@ in-@@ reli@@ e@@ ving effect and also wards off col@@ ds , eas@@ ing cou@@ gh@@ s and lowering fe@@ ver .
as a result , not more than half a li@@ tre should be consumed a day .
ras@@ p@@ ber@@ ry drin@@ k also makes you swe@@ at , so in winter , a qui@@ e@@ ter moment should be found to enjoy it .
in winter , use ras@@ p@@ ber@@ ry stal@@ ks to prepare the be@@ ver@@ age , while in summer , use leaves , shoo@@ ts or ber@@ ries .
to make half a li@@ tre of the drin@@ k , you &apos;@@ ll need a small bun@@ ch of bran@@ ches of a suitable length , which should be bo@@ iled until the water takes on a re@@ d@@ dis@@ h tone .
an inf@@ usion can also be made from ras@@ p@@ ber@@ ry stal@@ ks .
to do this , c@@ rush the stal@@ ks and keep them in warm water for a few hours .
processing them longer and more thoroughly will result in a stronger be@@ ver@@ age .
p@@ ine need@@ le te@@ a can be added to the ready ras@@ p@@ ber@@ ry drin@@ k as a flav@@ ouring .
Cha@@ ga mus@@ h@@ room te@@ a
Cha@@ ga mus@@ h@@ room is a fun@@ gu@@ s that grow@@ s on wood , and in the wild it looks like a piece of char@@ red wood attached to the tre@@ e .
it is mostly found on bir@@ ches , but also elsewhere .
the mus@@ h@@ room has a broad field of uses - as a hot be@@ ver@@ age , as a fi@@ re-@@ star@@ ter , an inc@@ en@@ se substitute etc .
the ash is also very good for was@@ hing one@@ self .
Cha@@ ga te@@ a is a kind of super@@ -@@ be@@ ver@@ age that can be used for many different illnesses , even for treating cancer or managing cancer symp@@ toms , as a ton@@ ic , for reducing stress and extending lif@@ es@@ p@@ an .
the fun@@ gu@@ s contains a number of unique comp@@ ounds and many B@@ -@@ complex vita@@ min@@ s , along with anti@@ o@@ x@@ id@@ ants and some min@@ er@@ als and protein .
the fun@@ gu@@ s te@@ a can be consumed every day , no danger of over@@ consumption .
a piece of fun@@ gu@@ s measuring about 3 x 3 c@@ m is sufficient for preparing the be@@ ver@@ age ; bo@@ il it in 2-@@ 3 lit@@ res of water for 5-@@ 15 minutes .
woman wal@@ king around the globe : my daily budget is $ 5 !
truth be told , I myself have had such an experience ; true , only 40 days , back when I decided to live the life of a va@@ g@@ ab@@ on@@ d in southern France , to just be free and live one day at a time .
I would s@@ lee@@ p in a tent in the forest in small@@ -@@ town train stations etc .
the second week , I joined a &quot; hom@@ eless &quot; French person , a 4@@ 4-@@ year-old man .
o@@ h , don &apos;t think that there were any homo@@ sexual tendencies or anything : we just spent the n@@ ights in the same par@@ k in M@@ en@@ ton and became friends ; even though he was 15 years older than I , he was a good compan@@ ion .
it turned out that the man was from a good family , from Paris , a former French na@@ val officer .
he di@@ d@@ n &apos;t use alcohol , di@@ d@@ n &apos;t commit mis@@ chief , in a word he was a decent person , intelligent , good to talk to , had seen a lot of this life .
in short , we pa@@ ired up in for the next three weeks and wan@@ dered around together from town to town , also for about € 5 a day for food .
and enough money would come in , enough to live off of .
he talked me how to offer my services on the ter@@ ra@@ ces of ho@@ tels and resta@@ ur@@ ants about to close in the evening and on farms along our way .
we did exactly enough work to get food money for the next two or three days .
at some point I developed a fe@@ ver and I decided that I cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;t keep on going ...
I got a flight to Hel@@ sin@@ ki and from there I returned home ...
and , incidentally , I still regret it .
those 40 days were probably the best of my life ...
J@@ ü@@ r@@ gen L@@ ig@@ i recently said on F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k : &quot; a quote is a poor excuse . &quot;
therefore I won &apos;t look back and try to recall what has been done historically to re-@@ pro@@ g@@ ra@@ m human nature and what results have been achieved .
I won &apos;t judge whether these attempts can be considered successes or failures .
I &apos;@@ ll also avoid excessive references to sources , even though I will proceed from the idea of my most important teacher T@@ o@@ om@@ as Paul : all of my thoughts are borro@@ wed from somewhere , if I could only remember from where exactly .
the most con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ous state project going on in Estonia right now is the re-@@ education of citizens of the Republic of Estonia - into perfect people .
we don &apos;t raise them like we raise a child - in good faith that the child will become a person .
we raise them the way the ruling class imag@@ ines it - what a person has to be like in order to be allowed to live in Estonia and speak publicly .
censorship is total .
although the local ruling class changed partially a year ago , some educational methods are just as frigh@@ tening as the ones of the previous ruling class , the now impover@@ ished no@@ bility - their bru@@ tality in no way falls short of the previous ones .
they &apos;@@ re just different .
Latvian be@@ er is the em@@ ble@@ matic be@@ ver@@ age of our new era of making fine adjustments .
B@@ A@@ C of 0.@@ 05 % obligatory for government officials
the ruling class do@@ es@@ n &apos;t include only the politicians who are paid salary by the state , but also the self-@@ aware people who engage in politics voluntarily ( read : inten@@ tionally ) , wrote opinion provo@@ cations after the example of Mi@@ h@@ ke@@ l M@@ ut@@ t , cur@@ se out their pe@@ ers on F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k as to how awful people around them here in de@@ generate Estonia live , pic@@ ket , boycot@@ t , ju@@ gg@@ le , and sa@@ b@@ o@@ tage .
they &apos;@@ re willing to live only in an echo chamber ( the E@@ n@@ g@@ lis@@ h@@ -@@ speaker &apos;s word for people who live in a space where they hear only opinions they like to hear , such as their own F@@ ac@@ eb@@ oo@@ k friends etc . ) but this is not possible in conf@@ li@@ cted Estonia .
there &apos;s always someone among us who thinks or does something that is intolerable for the echo chamber fol@@ k .
and the war of words breaks out and the fl@@ ame can@@ n@@ ons th@@ under .
we have very many politicians who know exactly Ho@@ w much a person should drin@@ k , whom they should s@@ lee@@ p with , how many children they should spa@@ wn , how much money to make , went to go on va@@ cation , what to think about , what to eat , how to enter@@ tain themselves , when to be sick , when to die .
in very important positions .
if they &apos;@@ re public comments are met by anything other than what they themselves sad , they are fu@@ rious , insul@@ ted , off@@ ended hy@@ ste@@ ric@@ al .
the fact that in a number of European countries , people drive around in a car , head full of boo@@ ze , and this is legal , do@@ es@@ n &apos;t sha@@ ke their opinion .
zero tolerance is the only allowed devi@@ ant behaviour in every m@@ un@@ ici@@ pal@@ ity , but it &apos;s not com@@ passion and care that is behind zero tolerance , but rather ou@@ tri@@ ght evil .
class hatred and racial hatred - only people like me are the right ones .
the sa@@ in@@ tly politicians are only able to open their mouth , but ne@@ ve their heart .
they believe that every &quot; measure &quot; that they make society better with works and is worth trying .
lu@@ ck@@ ily for them , we have a big enough bun@@ ch of cla@@ qu@@ e@@ urs , s@@ tun@@ t men with a deficit of spirit who leap through every window - without feeling any pain .
for that reason , it seems to us that if some cle@@ ver pe@@ as@@ ant opens their mouth and is be@@ at emo@@ tionally sen@@ se@@ less in the man@@ or stable for it , this is in fact reasonable .
some words that will definitely send us to the man@@ or stable are hom@@ o , refugee , woman , violence , get to work , among many others .
if we believed everything that the sel@@ f@@ less officials , activists and politicians ( such people make up only a small part of all groups , but they are able to sh@@ out so loud so that the whole society becomes dea@@ f ) , talk and write that citizens are not only n@@ as@@ ty , v@@ ul@@ gar and un@@ pleasant but also min@@ d@@ less , with no bra@@ ins .
but don &apos;t believe them , don &apos;t force them to tolerate it , don &apos;t prohibit drinking .
people in Estonia drin@@ k as much as they want , not as much as the state allows .
Est@@ onian people tolerate much more if they are@@ n &apos;t forced to tolerate things .
Est@@ onian people won &apos;t change their behaviour two months before the elections so that after the aim is achieved they can turn their back on their fa@@ d diet and yet again let in and also out of their mouth whatever quickly puts on the p@@ ounds in the form of fat on their brain .
whoever does anything different is not a proper Est@@ onian .
I don &apos;t think that any person can be re-@@ educated .
I believe that people can be taught .
to drin@@ k in moder@@ ation , to love their family , to be industri@@ ous , poli@@ te , char@@ ming compan@@ ion not just to their friends but to all of society .
to teach , it is@@ n &apos;t necessary to me@@ te out fines , lay si@@ e@@ ge to , prohibit , coer@@ ce , call to order , make stand in a cor@@ ner , hur@@ l ro@@ tten eggs at people while they &apos;@@ re in the media st@@ oc@@ ka@@ de .
a teacher has to be a role model .
a politician who smo@@ kes talks about how harmful tobacco is ?
a poli@@ ce@@ man who spe@@ eds when he &apos;s off duty is fin@@ ing me for speeding ?
and then gets caught by a co-@@ worker d@@ run@@ k ...
I have this ro@@ gue idea that maybe we should try to re-@@ edu@@ cate the ruling class , too .
tell them not to drin@@ k in secret .
if you drin@@ k , drin@@ k publicly : on T@@ own H@@ all S@@ qu@@ are , before the eyes of everyone .
to force them to exceed the speed limit only publicly - let the ru@@ lers &quot; cars , and private cars , too , all be red .
if you govern , govern as if you were governing yourself .
maybe the shame will be sufficient if your words and deeds don &apos;t alig@@ n .
or will we learn that we ourselves want the most de@@ ba@@ sed to govern us .
because all of us , people of Estonia , are the people we absolutely never want to be ourselves .
where to fle@@ e from our own sel@@ ves ?
ra@@ in@@ y weather is forecast for this weekend , making it a good time to undertake a proper work@@ out .

bus driver rescu@@ es eight pu@@ p@@ pi@@ es by side of the road , not knowing that the do@@ gs actually had an ow@@ ner .
&quot; where am I going t put these eight pu@@ p@@ pi@@ es , my wife would have kic@@ ked me out of the fl@@ at along with the do@@ gs , &quot; qui@@ ps O@@ le@@ g , the bus driver who saved pu@@ p@@ pi@@ es who were running around near a road un@@ super@@ vised , delivering them to a shel@@ ter sta@@ ff@@ er .
the ow@@ ner of the do@@ gs soon appeared at the p@@ ound , ba@@ ff@@ led as to why the pu@@ p@@ pi@@ es were taken away from his yard .
Har@@ j@@ u Coun@@ ty bus driver O@@ le@@ g said has had been working as a bus driver since the early 1990s , but had never had such an incident during his career . &quot; I dro@@ ve bus no . 14@@ 6 on my ordinary route .
near Har@@ ju@@ -@@ Ris@@ ti , I saw something small running around by the side of the road .
I thought it was a R@@ acc@@ o@@ on@@ -@@ do@@ g , but it turned out it was four pu@@ p@@ pi@@ es , &quot; recalled the driver .
O@@ le@@ g &apos;s heart mel@@ ted and stopped the bus , which was full of passengers , to collect the pu@@ ps .
&quot; I felt sorry for them , the cars would have hit them and c@@ rus@@ hed them , &quot; said O@@ le@@ g .
he added that the passengers were understanding and the pu@@ p@@ pi@@ es caused quite a happy sti@@ r abo@@ ard the bus .
the pu@@ p@@ pi@@ es were a bit sh@@ y at first , then became f@@ risky .
pu@@ p@@ pi@@ es on board , the bus driver dro@@ ve the route a second time , as the he had stick to the schedule .
driving past the place where he had found the pu@@ p@@ pi@@ es , he saw four more pu@@ p@@ pi@@ es in the same location .
these were German she@@ ph@@ er@@ d pu@@ p@@ pi@@ es .
their fu@@ r was so fine and they were clearly well ca@@ red for .
they were beautiful do@@ gs , aston@@ ish@@ ingly so .
my first thought was , of course , that someone was trying to get rid of them , &quot; said the driver , and for that reason he decided to bring the pu@@ ps on board .
&quot; I pic@@ ked up those four pu@@ ps too and then called the police , &quot; recalled O@@ le@@ g .
the police conta@@ cted the animal shel@@ ter , and a worker came to Baltic station to f@@ et@@ ch the pu@@ p@@ pi@@ es .
but was@@ n &apos;t the bus driver temp@@ ted to keep these fur@@ b@@ alls ?
yes , it occurred to me .
one of the pu@@ p@@ pi@@ es was so nice and calm .
sat nic@@ ely like an adult do@@ g , &quot; said O@@ le@@ g .
but where would I put eight pu@@ p@@ pi@@ es ?
my wife would have kic@@ ked me out of the fl@@ at along with the fo@@ gs .
we have a small child , too .
too early to take a do@@ g , &quot; he added .
T@@ all@@ in@@ n animal shel@@ ter director E@@ ve To@@ bi@@ as said that indeed 8 German she@@ ph@@ er@@ d pu@@ p@@ pi@@ es were brought to the shel@@ ter , two and a half months old .
but the same day , the ow@@ ner came to claim the lit@@ ter .
&quot; we di@@ d@@ n &apos;t even register the pu@@ p@@ pi@@ es at the shel@@ ter and just returned them , &quot; she said .
&quot; the do@@ g ow@@ ner was@@ n &apos;t very cross , but said that they have the only house in the field of vision and the bus driver should have asked whether the pu@@ p@@ pi@@ es were the@@ irs , &quot; said To@@ bi@@ as .
the shel@@ ter director added , however , that it was good that the bus driver did pick up the pu@@ p@@ pi@@ es ro@@ mp@@ ing near the road , and that nothing unfortunate happened to them .
actually , it was quite good on the part of the bus driver to react !
there is some ter@@ rain that ordinary vehicles just can &apos;t access , no matter how you try .
an A@@ TV is the solution .
Ka@@ it@@ se Ko@@ d@@ u ! provided an overview of the AT@@ V@@ s in use in the military sector .
use of such ligh@@ t@@ weight vehicles with good ter@@ rain coverage is nothing new in military structures .
the need for them first emerged during World War II , and serious interest began to be taken in them a decade later .
simpli@@ city and power
back in 195@@ 6 , the M@@ -@@ 27@@ 4 , which would be nic@@ k@@ named the mechan@@ ical mu@@ le , rol@@ led out of the W@@ ill@@ ys over@@ land plants - it was the next generation of a vehicle construc@@ ted in the closing years of W@@ W@@ II and meant for eva@@ cu@@ ating the w@@ ounded .
it is a bit od@@ d to call the mechan@@ ical mu@@ le a ne@@ x@@ t-@@ generation vehicle .
it is hard to imagine a more S@@ par@@ tan vehicle .
a platform with wh@@ eel@@ s , seat and a ste@@ ering whe@@ el : that &apos;s it , end of story .
it is as if over@@ ze@@ al@@ ous buil@@ ders gra@@ b@@ bed the blu@@ e@@ pr@@ ints from the engine@@ er &apos;s des@@ k too has@@ ti@@ ly and started production .
yet in war , off-@@ ro@@ ading ability counts a great deal more than comfor@@ t .
in this regard , there was no match for the mu@@ le when it was put to the test in the j@@ ung@@ les of Vietnam .
the ligh@@ t@@ weight machine , weigh@@ ing less than 500 k@@ g , managed to ef@@ for@@ tle@@ ssly drive in places where even the W@@ ill@@ ys Je@@ e@@ p , which had gar@@ ne@@ red my@@ th@@ ological f@@ ame for its ru@@ g@@ ge@@ dness , had to conce@@ de , f@@ las@@ hing its brak@@ e lights .
the vehicles with close to 500 k@@ g carrying capacity were mainly used for transport - both munitions and personnel .
sometimes ligh@@ ter reco@@ il@@ less anti-@@ tan@@ k weapons were moun@@ ted on the mu@@ le &apos;s back .
if such a vehicle came under fire , and it did happen , the driver could pi@@ vo@@ t the ste@@ ering system forward , so low that the vehicle could be operated lying on his st@@ om@@ ach .
the mu@@ les were produced until 19@@ 70 , a total of 1@@ 1@@ ,@@ 2@@ 40 were produced and they were in use by the Ar@@ my until 19@@ 80 , when they were replaced by the H@@ M@@ W@@ V@@ s that now reig@@ ned su@@ preme .
in the subsequent two decades , AT@@ V@@ s had more of a marg@@ inal importance in military cir@@ cles .
they re-@@ emerged after the T@@ win T@@ ow@@ ers cru@@ m@@ bled in New York and US soldiers found themselves in a shoo@@ ting war on the deser@@ t ter@@ rain of Iraq and Afghanistan .
it was there that the knowledge and re@@ ali@@ z@@ ation came about that something was needed to fill the gap between H@@ um@@ ve@@ e and inf@@ an@@ tr@@ y@@ man .
as AT@@ V@@ s generally di@@ d@@ n &apos;t provide significant protection , they are not the best choice for direct combat duty .
but fast and light vehicles are good for special missions .
for example , re@@ con@@ na@@ is@@ san@@ ce or rescue operations .
currently thousands of AT@@ V@@ s and U@@ T@@ V@@ s are in use by the American military .
most of them - like the X@@ U@@ V@@ 5@@ 5@@ s purchased for the Est@@ onian Defence League - are similar to the ones in civil commerce , but modified to meet the army &apos;s needs .
trade@@ marks now we@@ aring the cam@@ ou@@ fla@@ ge col@@ ours include such names as K@@ aw@@ as@@ a@@ ki mu@@ le , H@@ on@@ da ran@@ cher and Fo@@ re@@ man , Y@@ am@@ ah@@ a R@@ hin@@ o and Arctic c@@ at and the ever-@@ wider selection of models from the leading military A@@ TV manufacturer Pol@@ ar@@ is .
in 2013 , Pol@@ ar@@ is signed a five-year contract with US S@@ O@@ CO@@ M special forces centre for supply of two-@@ sea@@ ter M@@ R@@ Z@@ R@@ 2 and M@@ R@@ Z@@ R@@ 4@@ s and a separate five-year contract for one-@@ sea@@ ter M@@ V@@ 8@@ 5@@ 0s based on the Pol@@ ar@@ is spor@@ ts@@ man , which has inf@@ ra@@ red and black@@ -@@ out lights and innovative hon@@ ey@@ com@@ b tyres that ensure the vehicle remains oper@@ able after a hit from a 5@@ 0-@@ ce@@ li@@ b@@ re weapon .
before the M@@ V@@ 8@@ 50 came to market , Pol@@ ar@@ is managed to supply M@@ V@@ 700 and M@@ V@@ 800 vehicles to the military .
the M@@ V@@ 700 is a militari@@ zed version of the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ an-@@ use Pol@@ ar@@ is 7@@ 00@@ c@@ c T@@ win spor@@ ts@@ man , with the addition of win@@ ches in front and back , a two-@@ part fuel tan@@ k for covering longer distan@@ ces , a reinforced frame and under@@ carri@@ age and some military equipment that farmers and ho@@ b@@ by@@ ists on forest roads di@@ d@@ n &apos;t have much use for .
just like the John De@@ ere M@@ -@@ G@@ ators used successfully in Iraq and Afghanistan alongside the Pol@@ ar@@ is AT@@ V@@ s , it is equipped with weapons rests , a lu@@ gg@@ age ra@@ ck on the H@@ ood and a number of other elements that are useless on the ran@@ ch but necessary in a combat zone .
the 750 k@@ g vehicle is capable of carrying nearly its own weight in equipment - 5@@ 70 kil@@ og@@ ram@@ s of gear .
the engine capacity is enough to pull ligh@@ ter tra@@ ilers and arti@@ l@@ le@@ ry pieces .
the modi@@ fiable shape com@@ part@@ ment in the back , the sides of which can be removed , allows b@@ agg@@ age to be transported from point A to point B that is even bigger than the small but te@@ na@@ cious bu@@ g .
later , enhanced versions of the M@@ -@@ g@@ ator were also completed : the A@@ 1 , which is 20 H@@ P more powerful than the original 20 H@@ P M@@ -@@ g@@ ator , and the ensu@@ ing re@@ infor@@ c@@ ed@@ -@@ frame A@@ 2 , which is even better for transpor@@ ting and to@@ wing weight , and the A@@ 3 , which comb@@ ines the positive qualities of the A@@ 1 and A@@ 2 .
actually , the M@@ -@@ G@@ ators had their ba@@ p@@ tis@@ m of fire in 1997 and 1998 in Bosnia , when medicine bri@@ ga@@ des used them to eva@@ cu@@ ate the w@@ ounded .
at the same time , they reduced the load on soldiers travel@@ ing on their own foot power , transpor@@ ting their gear that they would otherwise have had to to@@ te on their back .
where as most AT@@ V@@ s used in military structures are modi@@ fications of ci@@ vi@@ li@@ an-@@ use vehicles , there are some exceptions .
the most outstanding of these are the war@@ hor@@ ses called Pro@@ w@@ ler , made by P@@ ho@@ en@@ i@@ x International , which have seen successful use in all sorts of combat , rec@@ on and rescue missions around the world .
the manufacturer claims these vehicles , which were first introduced and used for special operations , overcome the bot@@ t@@ len@@ ec@@ ks typical of AT@@ V@@ s in conventional use and also of the ones that have been modified for the army , in terms of handling , ru@@ g@@ ge@@ dness and safety .
being similar to an ordinary A@@ TV in terms of build and size , the Pro@@ w@@ ler is nevertheless completely different in construction and capability .
it is faster , more du@@ rable , more stable , and is able to pull and carry more weight than other vehicles of the same type .
for example , in the case of an ordinary A@@ TV , the driver has to constantly shift their body &apos;s position to maintain vehicle balance and use both arms to manoeuvre , accelerate and de@@ ce@@ le@@ rate , but operating a Pro@@ w@@ ler is more like driving a car .
yet at the end of the day there &apos;s no difference whether it &apos;s a Pro@@ w@@ ler , g@@ ator , M@@ V@@ 8@@ 50 or some other A@@ TV or U@@ TV - the concept and area of use is similar for all of them .
and it &apos;s clear that in conditions where defence spending cuts are generally sought and s@@ m@@ alle@@ r@@ -@@ scale operations aimed at a specified target is favoured over broad@@ -based conventional war@@ fare , light and a@@ gi@@ le small vehicles have joined the army in order to stay in service .
&quot; my watch died , but I di@@ d@@ n &apos;t , &quot; actor Ra@@ iv@@ o E@@ . Tam@@ m qui@@ pped with a broad gri@@ n at the finish of I@@ ron@@ man 7@@ 0.@@ 3 .
true , for the entire full-@@ length tri@@ a@@ th@@ l@@ on , the s@@ mi@@ le ten@@ ded not to qu@@ it Ra@@ iv@@ o &apos;s face .
moreover , while running 21.@@ 1 km , he even got caught up in conver@@ sation : &quot; I was cha@@ tting with a gu@@ y while running , someone passed me and was amaz@@ ed : &quot; J@@ es@@ us , you have the energy to talk ! &quot;
Ra@@ iv@@ o , who had energy for conver@@ sation , did switch to speed@@ wal@@ king a few times .
at his coach &apos;s suggestion .
&quot; A@@ in-@@ A@@ lar Ju@@ h@@ ans@@ on said that it was OK to wal@@ k up@@ hil@@ l and there was no point in forcing yourself to run , because there are some as@@ c@@ ents and in terms of time there &apos;s no difference whether you run or speed@@ -@@ wal@@ k , &quot; said the actor , who noted he had taken his coach &apos;s advice to heart .
he was also able to catch his b@@ reat@@ h during the wal@@ king parts and perhaps that is why he was able to give inter@@ views left and right without pan@@ ting after crossing the finish line .
as if he ha@@ d@@ n &apos;t just sw@@ um 1.@@ 9 km , cy@@ cle@@ d 90 km and run 21.@@ 1 km .
&quot; I think my physical form was such that I could enjoy the race , &quot; Ra@@ iv@@ o , who started training in January and has so far lost 16 k@@ g , ad@@ mits with a c@@ hu@@ ck@@ le .
and as for the inter@@ views , that was my desire , that I would have the energy to give inter@@ views after the finish .
I have been able to do inter@@ views after every race , and I hoped that it would be great to be able to do so after O@@ te@@ p@@ ä@@ ä I@@ ron@@ man .
I thought that it would be good if I we@@ re@@ n &apos;t collapsed in a hea@@ p after the I@@ ron@@ man . &quot; on quite the contrary to lying in a hea@@ p , Ra@@ iv@@ o presented quite a different picture upon crossing the finish line : hands out@@ stret@@ ched sk@@ y@@ ward and a sincere tri@@ ump@@ h sh@@ ining on his face .
there was good reason : it took 46 minutes ad 24 seconds for Ra@@ iv@@ o to s@@ wi@@ m 1.@@ 9 km , 3 hours and 32 minutes to cycle 90 km , and 2@@ H@@ O@@ U@@ RS and 18 minutes to run 21.@@ 1 km .
&quot; my heart now belongs to the tri@@ a@@ th@@ l@@ on , &quot; Ra@@ iv@@ o says , who sh@@ ou@@ ted already at the finish that he has mar@@ ried his for@@ tun@@ es to running .
I have already registered myself for the 20 August gra@@ n f@@ on@@ do - 2@@ 30 km from T@@ all@@ in@@ n to T@@ ar@@ tu on b@@ ike !
so it &apos;s off to training again tomorrow !
strong wind@@ s are in the forecast for the third day of the weekend F@@ esti@@ val .
indeed , the Õ@@ h@@ tu@@ le@@ h@@ t photo@@ g@@ rap@@ her &apos;s l@@ ens caught a Se@@ a@@ G@@ ul@@ l in dist@@ ress , who was trying to def@@ y the wind and take flight .
due to the wind@@ y weather , many f@@ esti@@ val@@ go@@ ers have said that s@@ and is getting in their mouth and eyes .
I think it &apos;s gone pretty well for us .
we &apos;@@ ve managed our work and our activities well , &quot; says P@@ ä@@ r@@ n@@ u police chief And@@ res S@@ in@@ im@@ eri as to how the first two days of weekend have gone for them .
S@@ in@@ im@@ eri says that today as well , pat@@ rol@@ s and first respon@@ ders are on the streets and talking to people - in other words people have questions and want to know how one becomes a first respon@@ der .
over these two days , the police have had to deal with some bra@@ w@@ ls and a few dru@@ g@@ -related incidents .
&quot; there was also some cases of possession of large quantities of nar@@ co@@ tic substances , but we will draw our conclusions once weekend is over , &quot; says S@@ in@@ im@@ eri .
over two days , about a hundred people have been down to the P@@ ä@@ r@@ n@@ u police station .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , the police have not had to solve any extreme incidents .
incidentally , S@@ in@@ im@@ eri says that if the ski@@ es open up and the rain comes down in she@@ ets , they won &apos;t have much to do .
one Ha@@ ap@@ sal@@ u police field chief has once said that rain is like having an extra pat@@ ro@@ l unit .
P@@ ä@@ r@@ n@@ u police have set up a staff in the weekend grounds , with a lost and found and a place to claim lost articles .
incidentally , the police themselves lost an important gi@@ z@@ mo , which good citizens took to the lost and found .
watch the video of And@@ res S@@ in@@ im@@ eri &apos;s full comments to Õ@@ h@@ tu@@ le@@ h@@ t .
weekend F@@ esti@@ val Baltic b@@ os@@ s G@@ un@@ na@@ r Vi@@ ese tells Õ@@ h@@ tu@@ le@@ h@@ t that the f@@ esti@@ val started years ago in Finland and its owners inspe@@ cted a stri@@ p of be@@ ach near R@@ ig@@ a in regard to expansion , and om the way back they made a stop in P@@ ä@@ r@@ n@@ u and that is how the f@@ esti@@ val was sold to Estonia .
G@@ un@@ na@@ r says their target is set at 25@@ ,@@ 000 visitors a day , but the chic@@ k@@ ens are coun@@ ted only after the f@@ esti@@ val is over .
the preparations for the f@@ esti@@ val started back in September last year .
&quot; we were given information from the city that construction would be going on in the last grounds , a ho@@ tel was being built there , &quot; says G@@ un@@ na@@ r as to the change they had to face this year .
currently no bul@@ l@@ do@@ z@@ ers can be seen there but it &apos;s presu@@ med that since the ear@@ th-@@ moving di@@ d@@ n &apos;t start this year , it will next year .
one way or another , we would have had to move at some point , &quot; he says as to why the f@@ esti@@ val grounds moved this year .
f@@ esti@@ val organ@@ iz@@ ing work goes on all year for them .
from 1@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ 1@@ ,@@ 500 people work at weekend - police , organ@@ iz@@ ing team , volunte@@ ers , v@@ end@@ ors , security team and so forth .
the hardest thing , Vi@@ ese said , was getting the Cha@@ in@@ smokers du@@ o to perform at weekend .
the gu@@ ys are currently the un@@ disputed top act in the po@@ p music world .
for why it was hard to get the Cha@@ in@@ smokers for weekend and how does G@@ un@@ na@@ r comment on the fact that two artists pul@@ led out , watch the video .
Th@@ under@@ cl@@ ou@@ ds are approaching Estonia from the west .
th@@ under has already been heard in northern Estonia and sc@@ at@@ tered f@@ las@@ hes of ligh@@ t@@ ning seen .
this afternoon , the weather service issued a th@@ under@@ storm warning .
today there will be th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms mainly in various places in northern Estonia .
th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms are moving rapidly from west to east .
&quot; G@@ ust of sou@@ th@@ west wind will be up to 15 m / s inland , and up to 18 m / s on the islands and coast , but stronger gus@@ ts are possible during th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms , &quot; the weather service website says .
a much bigger th@@ under@@ storm is ra@@ ging in sou@@ the@@ ast Finland and east of S@@ t@@ . Peter@@ s@@ burg in Russia .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , wind@@ s in Estonia are from the west and sou@@ th@@ west so there is no threat at least for now that the bigger stor@@ ms will head to Estonia .
F@@ in@@ ns hold dance f@@ esti@@ val for their men
when the first men &apos;s dance f@@ esti@@ val was held in R@@ ak@@ ver@@ e 11 years ago , the organ@@ iz@@ ers probably di@@ d@@ n &apos;t dream that the northern neighbours would use the small Est@@ onian city as an example .
but today La@@ pu@@ a in western Finland is holding the first Finnish men &apos;s dance f@@ esti@@ val .
&quot; the representatives of La@@ pu@@ a were so inspired by the last men &apos;s dance f@@ esti@@ val held in the sis@@ ter city that they wanted to do something similar , &quot; said R@@ ak@@ ver@@ e &apos;s de@@ puty may@@ or , K@@ ai@@ ri@@ t Pi@@ h@@ la@@ k .
and so today in La@@ pu@@ a &apos;s ba@@ se@@ ball sta@@ di@@ um , there will be two perfor@@ man@@ ces of Mi@@ es@@ -@@ T@@ ans@@ si@@ pi@@ do , where 100 men from the V@@ ir@@ u@@ ma@@ a region of northern Estonia will also take part , as part of the Finnish national cen@@ ten@@ ary celebra@@ tions , said Pi@@ h@@ la@@ k .
Pi@@ h@@ la@@ k said it was a super@@ b example of good cooperation between two friendship cities
it also marks the cen@@ ten@@ ary years for the re@@ public@@ s of Estonia and Finland .
among the hundred dan@@ c@@ ers is the winner of R@@ ak@@ et@@ t 69 from two se@@ as@@ ons ago , K@@ ari Re@@ in@@ k@@ u@@ b@@ j@@ as .
&quot; I have the honour to be one of a hundred men , who by taking part in Finland , show what V@@ ir@@ u men are capable of , &quot; he said .
&quot; R@@ ak@@ ver@@ e &apos;s dan@@ cing men have li@@ m@@ be@@ red themselves up in preparation for the Finnish men &apos;s dance f@@ esti@@ val so that they can show a proper c@@ ali@@ b@@ re at our northern neighbours , &quot; R@@ ak@@ ver@@ e city government member a@@ in S@@ u@@ u@@ r@@ ka@@ e@@ v commen@@ ted on the event .
the V@@ ir@@ u@@ ma@@ a men &apos;s performance has been arran@@ ged into a whole by the artistic director of the dance en@@ se@@ mble T@@ ar@@ van@@ p@@ ä@@ ä , Ti@@ i@@ u M@@ ü@@ r@@ k , along with well-known cho@@ ir conduc@@ tor el@@ o Ü@@ le@@ o@@ ja .
the Est@@ on@@ i@@ ans &quot; cho@@ re@@ og@@ rap@@ h@@ y is based on Est@@ onian ch@@ oral music .
the first Est@@ onian men &apos;s dance f@@ esti@@ val was held in 2006 , and the last one to date was in R@@ ak@@ ver@@ e in 2015 .
although the media &apos;s attention has been mainly focused on P@@ ä@@ r@@ n@@ u and the weekend f@@ esti@@ val taking place there , it is not the only music f@@ esti@@ val this weekend .
P@@ õ@@ l@@ v@@ am@@ a@@ a &apos;s In@@ t@@ si@@ k@@ u@@ r@@ m@@ u f@@ esti@@ val has its loy@@ al f@@ ans , too .
one of them wri@@ tes on T@@ wit@@ ter : &quot; I sold off my weekend ticket so I could go to In@@ t@@ si@@ k@@ u@@ r@@ m@@ u . &quot;
and why not .
besides domestic artists , perfor@@ mers from America , Finland , Lithuania , Hungary , England and elsewhere will take the stage .
the f@@ esti@@ val held in a ma@@ gical forest comes as a surprise for the perfor@@ mers , too , due to its location .
one of them , Lu@@ cy Ro@@ se , on T@@ wit@@ ter in the early morning , cou@@ l@@ d@@ n &apos;t get over how beautiful a place Estonia was .
but neither have f@@ esti@@ val@@ go@@ ers not been st@@ ing@@ y in sharing ni@@ f@@ ty facts and observations .
to be a part of In@@ t@@ si@@ k@@ u@@ r@@ m@@ u f@@ esti@@ val ma@@ gic yourself , view the gallery !
although the weekend is here , your appe@@ tite for being bus@@ y has@@ n &apos;t gone away .
your hands and feet are still it@@ ching to work , you &apos;@@ re trying to encourage others to get bus@@ y , too .
you could forget your worries and go off on a ge@@ ta@@ way with your better half .
take some time for yourself to enjoy each other &apos;s company in some co@@ sy , ro@@ man@@ tic place .
talking on some exc@@ iting subject , you get fired up , make big plans , perhaps make promises ... which you forget about a moment later .
the other party re@@ members what you said , though .
no doubt your de@@ me@@ an@@ our is rest@@ less , it &apos;s hard to focus on any activity .
your m@@ ood do@@ es@@ n &apos;t necessarily depend on what is happening now but on things that happened earlier .
when you find yourself in a complicated situation , you are able to act in a rapid and rational manner .
it &apos;s possible that you will help someone out of a ja@@ m , because you have enough smar@@ ts and stic@@ k@@ -to-@@ it@@ -@@ ness .
instead , forget worrying about money and business matters .
take time to rest and rela@@ x .
going to crow@@ ded events can be ti@@ ring and stra@@ in your ner@@ ves .
it &apos;s possible you might ac@@ ci@@ den@@ tally find yourself in a situation that es@@ c@@ ala@@ tes into a serious dispute in the course of which you have to asser@@ tively defend your position .
if others cross a line , don &apos;t you do it .
you feel better in the environment you are ac@@ custom@@ ed to , doing things you know how to do and which make you happy .
you probably don &apos;t thir@@ st after new knowledge and ad@@ ven@@ tures .
having fu@@ n is something that will probably never completely sa@@ ti@@ ate you .
today as well , something is calling you to soci@@ ali@@ ze .
what happens at the party may not be conventional .
it may happen that despite your day off you may have to resolve work@@ -related problems .
or although you are physi@@ cally at home , in your mind you &apos;@@ re still at your des@@ k at work .
if you want th@@ ri@@ l@@ ls , travel can offer them .
the wh@@ ir@@ l@@ pool of ad@@ venture will su@@ ck you in , you will have to get yourself together to stay on the cre@@ st and maintain your balance .
don &apos;t waste energy arguing about money matters .
take up the topic only if the situation really requires rapid and decisive intervention .
a man who st@@ ole three am@@ pli@@ fi@@ ers from a mos@@ que was bur@@ ned alive in Indon@@ esia , Hungarian news agency M@@ T@@ I reports .
the 3@@ 0-@@ year-old thi@@ ef s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ed out of the mos@@ que in the city of Be@@ kas@@ i near the capital J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta with the am@@ pli@@ fi@@ ers on 1 August , but the security guard at the mos@@ que saw him and sh@@ ou@@ ted : &quot; stop the thi@@ ef ! &quot;
help came and the thi@@ ef began to be pursued .
the thi@@ ef fled on motor@@ b@@ ike and even s@@ wa@@ m across a river .
the ch@@ ase las@@ ted a few kilometres , then a stone thrown by one of the pursu@@ ers hit the man in the head , seriously inju@@ ring him .
the en@@ ra@@ ged mo@@ b of pursu@@ ers caught the thi@@ ef and be@@ at him .
one of the pursu@@ ers p@@ oured petrol over the thi@@ ef and set him al@@ ight .
the man who was set on fire died at the scene .
his body was taken to East J@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta police hospital .
the police im@@ p@@ ounded the dece@@ ased &apos;s motor@@ b@@ ike and the st@@ ole@@ n am@@ pli@@ fi@@ ers .
the local press initially published reports that it had not been a thi@@ ef but an elec@@ tri@@ cian who wanted to take the am@@ pli@@ fi@@ ers to be re@@ pa@@ ired .
the police decisively coun@@ tered these claims .
the relatives of the man who was bur@@ ned to death said they would not file charges .
the German news agency D@@ PA said the reason for this step is that Indon@@ esi@@ ans do not have particular trust in the police or judicial bodies .
Indon@@ esia is the world &apos;s largest Muslim country .
of the 2@@ 55 million inhabitants , Muslims account for 8@@ 7.@@ 2 % .
Est@@ onian children &apos;s clothing st@@ y@@ les influenced by car@@ to@@ ons
while in Europe and America , children &apos;s fas@@ hi@@ ons are often influenced by what the children of the ro@@ y@@ al families or ce@@ le@@ bri@@ ties are we@@ aring , Est@@ onian parents choose clo@@ th@@ es for their off@@ spring based on what is happening on the c@@ in@@ em@@ a scre@@ en .
the young British P@@ rin@@ ce George is becoming a true fashion gu@@ r@@ u , on the example of his mother Du@@ ch@@ ess Catherine .
like his mother , the pr@@ ince with his clo@@ th@@ es is capable of un@@ le@@ as@@ hing a real shopping f@@ ren@@ zy , which even has a term of its own - the P@@ rin@@ ce George effect .
the last occasion was a few weeks ago on the ro@@ y@@ al family &apos;s visit to Poland , where George wor@@ e a 10-@@ euro blue and red stri@@ ped d@@ ress shir@@ t by the Spanish br@@ and Ti@@ zz@@ as . parents caught up by the cra@@ ze emp@@ tied out the br@@ and &apos;s online store in just 24 hours .
there probably we@@ re@@ n &apos;t all that many sh@@ op@@ p@@ ers from Estonia among them , as our parents are allegedly completely non@@ pl@@ us@@ sed by the ro@@ y@@ al family &apos;s children &apos;s du@@ ds .
Kau@@ b@@ am@@ a@@ ja depart@@ ment store head of communications Anna An@@ s@@ mit@@ t says that the children of the sta@@ r couples and foreign fashion trends generally don &apos;t influence our parents &quot; purchases .
in Estonia , the biggest tr@@ end@@ set@@ ters are fil@@ ms , car@@ to@@ ons and also Y@@ ou@@ Tu@@ be channels .
and this the most popular products in recent years have been f@@ id@@ get sp@@ in@@ ners , games with charac@@ ters from the anim@@ ated film frozen , d@@ ol@@ ls , clothing , dan@@ cing do@@ gs or ca@@ ts , hat@@ ching pen@@ gu@@ ins and so on . &quot;
yet she also says that if desired , it &apos;s also possible in Estonia to d@@ ress their k@@ ids similarly to European pr@@ inc@@ es or prin@@ ces@@ ses .
man takes model hostage , planning to sell her on the dark web .
a Polish citizen took a British model hostage in Italy .
the man was planning to au@@ ction off the 20-@@ year-old woman on the dark W@@ e@@ b - the en@@ c@@ ry@@ p@@ ted Internet , the Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an reported .
the police say the woman was lu@@ red to Mil@@ an on 11 July with the promise of work on a pho@@ to shoo@@ t .
instead , she was dru@@ gged and taken to a vil@@ la near Tu@@ rin .
allegedly her cap@@ tors tried to sell her on the dark web for 2@@ 3@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 p@@ ounds and sent a ran@@ so@@ m note to her mo@@ del@@ ling agency .
the woman &apos;s cap@@ tor took her to the British consu@@ late on 17 July , however .

sensitive details of vulnerable children in care released in depart@@ ment b@@ ung@@ le
the personal details of children in care , including whether they were sexu@@ ally active , was ac@@ ci@@ den@@ tally sent to the mother of one of the children in a trou@@ b@@ ling information breach .
a spre@@ ad@@ she@@ et was ema@@ iled to the mother out@@ lining the name , bir@@ th@@ date , location , and specific concerns and al@@ er@@ ts relating to all children in the care of a large service provider in a regional Vic@@ tor@@ ian city .
the ema@@ il revealed where each child was staying .
a 13@@ -@@ year-old bo@@ y is listed as being on ba@@ il and dis@@ playing sexu@@ alised beha@@ vi@@ ours , a 15@@ -@@ year-old gir@@ l who has issues with self-@@ harm , substance abuse , and ab@@ s@@ con@@ ding is &quot; out with the bo@@ y@@ friend &quot; and &quot; will not be returning tonight , &quot; and a 14@@ -@@ year-old bo@@ y is noted as ne@@ eding help with &quot; self-@@ care &quot; and being ver@@ b@@ ally ab@@ us@@ ive and physi@@ cally threatening .
the spre@@ ad@@ she@@ et appears to be a hand@@ over document which was meant to have been sent to an overnight super@@ vis@@ or .
it contains notes about when some children are expected home , or whether they are likely to contact staff to be pic@@ ked up .
there are concerning levels of detail about some children .
&quot; if staff contact to request permission to conduct a room search or lap@@ top / US@@ B search , given concerns in regards to inappropriate sexual material , permission to be granted , &quot; the alert for a 15@@ -@@ year-old bo@@ y reads .
the document also shows that a 17@@ -@@ year-old gir@@ l who is only three months from turning 18 and being released from residential care was considered to be such a high risk of attempting suicide that staff had to call tri@@ ple zero immediately if she ab@@ s@@ con@@ ded .
a 16@@ -@@ year-old bo@@ y on pa@@ role is listed as out , and that he will &quot; contact staff to be pic@@ ked up later on tonight . &quot;
while the locations listed only mention the name of the housing unit where the children are being held , and not the address of the unit , there is enough detail for it to be found .
details of the 2015 breach emerged as the mother shared with F@@ air@@ fa@@ x Me@@ dia her experiences of dealing with the De@@ part@@ ment of Health and Human Services and child protection services since her da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter was taken into care four years ago .
she agreed to share her concerns now that her da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter has turned 18 and left the system .
the hear@@ t-@@ w@@ ren@@ ching decision to turn her da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter over to child protection came after a violent incident at home , one of a growing number of family violence complaints being made by parents against their children .
it had trou@@ b@@ ling consequences the mother could have never imag@@ ined , such as her da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter ra@@ cking up seven criminal charges within six months of leaving home , being moved hundreds of kilometres away , to a home and situation she appeared to thri@@ ve in , but then being moved back again without her parents being told , and the acceptance and facilitation by her da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter &apos;s carers of two relationships her da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter had with older men .
the first of these bo@@ y@@ friends , a 17@@ -@@ year-old who her then 15@@ -@@ year-old da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter had regularly been allowed by care agencies to stay with in a local ho@@ tel , ended when he was charged within days of his 18@@ th bir@@ th@@ day with child sex offences because of the relationship .
&quot; why was she left worse off than when she went in ? &quot; the mother said .
&quot; and is this what happens to every child in care ? &quot;
she is a particularly strong advocate for the establishment of a facility which allows D@@ H@@ HS to monitor children for the first few weeks of them being taken into care , before they are moved into residential homes .
this would allow them to better understand how they intera@@ ct with others , their risks and their needs , particularly in relation to education .
the state government is looking at new ways to diver@@ t children away from residential care , including by better supporting their parents .
targeted care packages , funded with $ 62 million over four years , aim to help transition children from residential care to better arrangements .
and a $ 5.@@ 6 million , two-@@ year trial announced last October will provide professional foster carers to at least 28 children , helping them to transition from or avoid entering care .
a depart@@ ment spokes@@ man said the information breach was not formally reported at the time , although the mother claims she told two depart@@ ment employees within months of it occurring .
the depart@@ ment is now working with the service provider to address the incident .
&quot; any claim of a privacy breach is taken very seriously ... we will work to ensure there has been no negative impact on the young people involved . &quot;
in July last year , Minister for Fam@@ ili@@ es and Chil@@ dren , J@@ en@@ n@@ y M@@ ik@@ a@@ kos , commission@@ ed an independent review of a sam@@ ple of child protection privacy incidents over a five-year period .
the depart@@ ment accepted its seven recommendations , and has since updated the child protection manu@@ al to ensure staff are clear about their roles and procedures in relation to privacy , changed IT systems to remove the automatic population of some personal details , and formally reviewed the depart@@ ment &apos;s privacy functions .

I@@ so@@ bel Ken@@ ner@@ ley , who was a member of the Du@@ ch@@ ess &apos;s bro@@ w@@ ni@@ e pac@@ k , had beg@@ ged to be allowed to die after a three@@ -year battle with a brain tu@@ m@@ our that left her with &quot; the utmost pain , dist@@ ress and loss of dignity . &quot;
the 3@@ 4-@@ year-old , who had ce@@ re@@ b@@ ral pal@@ sy , was diagno@@ sed with a brain tu@@ m@@ our in 2014 but suffered horri@@ fically before she eventually died in May , her mother has said .
Chris@@ tine E@@ ele@@ y , 65 , from Ne@@ w@@ bur@@ y , Ber@@ ks , has called for a change in the law to enable termin@@ ally-@@ ill and men@@ tally competent people to be able to &quot; control the manner and the timing &quot; of their deaths .
she said she had been left &quot; trau@@ ma@@ tised &quot; by her da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter &apos;s painful death and wished the law had allowed her to put a plan in place that would have enabled her da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter to die with dignity when her condition deterior@@ ated .

at 26 , Chris@@ ti@@ e appears un@@ reco@@ g@@ n@@ is@@ able from the fragile young woman who recently con@@ templa@@ ted wal@@ king away from the ice rin@@ k for good .
the vicious abuse had cut her to the quick , doub@@ ly so because she had been bul@@ li@@ ed as a child at her school in West Lo@@ th@@ ian .
today , she ex@@ u@@ des a confidence that the or@@ deal can yet come full circle with at least one gold in P@@ ye@@ on@@ g@@ chan@@ g .

&quot; physi@@ cally and psy@@ ch@@ ologically , I feel in the right state to be able to do it . &quot;
once , she had enter@@ tained visions of a career as a f@@ ig@@ u@@ re-@@ s@@ ka@@ ter , until the a@@ es@@ thetic elements began to turn her off .
&quot; I was really good at ju@@ mp@@ ing , but I strugg@@ led with the ar@@ ty side of it , &quot; she says , laugh@@ ing .
&quot; I was@@ n &apos;t so good at being e@@ leg@@ ant , ti@@ dy .
it was a sensible choice , because my personality is much more suited to short track . &quot;
Vietnam &apos; Re@@ gre@@ ts &apos; Germany &apos;s kidna@@ pping accus@@ ation
Vietnam said Thursday that it regret@@ ted comments by the German Foreign Ministry accus@@ ing Vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese intelligence services of kidna@@ pping a former Vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese oil executive who &apos;s wanted back home on em@@ be@@ zz@@ le@@ ment charges .
German authorities believe T@@ rin@@ h X@@ u@@ an T@@ han@@ h was s@@ na@@ t@@ ched in Berlin and gave the Vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese intelligence atta@@ che 48 hours on Wednesday to leave the country .
T@@ han@@ h faces em@@ be@@ zz@@ le@@ ment charges , which carry the death penalty .
he had sought asylum in Germany but his application had not been processed yet while Vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese authorities sought his extradition .
Vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese Foreign Ministry spokes@@ woman Le T@@ hi Th@@ u Han@@ g told re@@ por@@ ters that the comments were &quot; very regrettable &quot; and that T@@ han@@ h turned himself in to police in Vietnam on July 31 .
&quot; Vietnam always attaches importance to and wishes to develop strategic relations with Germany , &quot; she said , without elabor@@ ating .
T@@ han@@ h , 51 , disappeared in July last year after he was initially accused of mis@@ management at a subsidi@@ ary of national oil and gas gi@@ ant Pet@@ ro@@ Vietnam , resulting in losses of some $ 150 million .
Vi@@ et@@ nam@@ ese police issued an arrest warrant in September .
in March , police opened an investigation into em@@ be@@ zz@@ le@@ ment over his alleged involvement in a property development project .
T@@ han@@ h was chairman of Pet@@ ro@@ Vietnam Con@@ struction Joint Sto@@ ck Cor@@ por@@ ation until 2013 , when he was appointed to several senior government positions , including vice chairman of Ha@@ u Gi@@ ang province in the southern Me@@ k@@ on@@ g Del@@ ta .
he was elected to the National Assembly in May 201@@ 6 , but was dis@@ missed from the Commun@@ is@@ t@@ -@@ dominated legisla@@ ture before its first session the following month .
he was also stri@@ pped of his Communist Party membership .
Vietnam &apos;s amb@@ assador to Germany was sum@@ mon@@ ed to the Foreign Ministry on Tuesday and was told that Germany demanded that T@@ han@@ h be returned so that the asylum and extradition proceedings could be conducted properly .
Co@@ ck@@ ro@@ ac@@ hes spread se@@ eds , too , research shows
like bir@@ ds and m@@ am@@ m@@ als , co@@ ck@@ ro@@ ac@@ hes spread se@@ eds , too .
the in@@ sec@@ ts are mostly known for their role as de@@ com@@ po@@ sers , helping to break down de@@ ca@@ ying matter on the forest floor .
but co@@ ck@@ ro@@ ac@@ hes also help dis@@ per@@ se se@@ eds .
scientists in Japan found co@@ ck@@ ro@@ ac@@ hes were essential to the se@@ ed dis@@ per@@ s@@ al of a forest her@@ b species , Mon@@ ot@@ ro@@ pas@@ tru@@ m hu@@ mi@@ le .
the her@@ b is an unusual plant .
it has no ch@@ lo@@ ro@@ phy@@ l , leaving it unable to perform photo@@ syn@@ the@@ sis .
instead , the species gets its nutri@@ ents from fun@@ g@@ i growing bene@@ ath the soil &apos;s surface .
the plant dro@@ ps tin@@ y , o@@ dor@@ less , pal@@ e white fru@@ its on the forest floor .
the fru@@ its have little to no flav@@ or , and researchers in Japan found bir@@ d and m@@ am@@ mal species were un@@ interested in the food source .
only a hand@@ ful of in@@ ver@@ te@@ b@@ rate consumed the fruit &apos;s pul@@ p , and the forest co@@ ck@@ ro@@ ach , B@@ la@@ t@@ tel@@ la ni@@ p@@ pon@@ ica , was the only species to visit the fruit consistently .
researchers examined co@@ ck@@ ro@@ ach f@@ ec@@ es to determine whether the in@@ sec@@ ts helped dis@@ per@@ se the plant &apos;s se@@ eds .
scientists found each f@@ ec@@ es pe@@ l@@ let ex@@ pelled after eating the fruit fe@@ atu@@ red an average of three se@@ eds .
further te@@ st@@ ings proved the majority of dig@@ es@@ ted se@@ eds were viable .
scientists hypo@@ the@@ size that the unique her@@ b species likely evol@@ ved to take advantage of the co@@ ck@@ ro@@ ach &apos;s ability to dis@@ per@@ se se@@ eds .
the plant han@@ gs its fruit at ground level , and the fru@@ its ri@@ pen at the same time co@@ ck@@ ro@@ ac@@ hes emerge from their pu@@ pa stage .
researchers published their findings this week in the bot@@ an@@ ical J@@ our@@ nal of the L@@ in@@ ne@@ an Soci@@ ety .
&quot; given that about 4@@ ,@@ 600 co@@ ck@@ ro@@ ach species have been identified to date , co@@ ck@@ ro@@ ach@@ -@@ medi@@ ated se@@ ed dis@@ per@@ s@@ al may be a more per@@ va@@ sive but an as yet un@@ documented mechanism , rather than a unique exploit by a particular plant species , &quot; Na@@ o@@ to Su@@ gi@@ ur@@ a , an associ@@ ate prof@@ es@@ sor at K@@ um@@ am@@ o@@ to University , said in a news release .
&quot; it is hoped that the findings reported here will encourage people to pay more attention to plan@@ t-@@ co@@ ck@@ ro@@ ach intera@@ ctions and seek out further examples of co@@ ck@@ ro@@ ach@@ -@@ medi@@ ated se@@ ed dis@@ per@@ s@@ al . &quot;
F@@ ly@@ n@@ n files amended disclosure report showing additional payments
Michael F@@ ly@@ n@@ n , who served briefly as President tru@@ mp &apos;s national security advi@@ ser , fi@@ led an amended federal financial disclosure report late Thursday providing new details about his contracts with the tru@@ mp presidential transition , a company connected to an Iranian American business@@ man , and the parent company of a data science firm that worked for the tru@@ mp campaign .
in a letter accompanying his revised disclosure , F@@ ly@@ n@@ n noted that his initial disclosure reports were fi@@ led under rus@@ hed circumstances without the custom@@ ary consultation and review provided by White House lawyers and the Office of Government E@@ th@@ ics .
the letter said F@@ ly@@ n@@ n did not receive the attention afforded others because he was no longer a White House employee at the time .
F@@ ly@@ n@@ n re@@ signed his post just 24 days after taking office amid reports that he mis@@ led V@@ ice President p@@ ence about the nature of his contacts after the election with the Russian amb@@ assador to the United States .
F@@ ly@@ n@@ n also drew criticism over foreign payments he received while working in the private sector after stepping down as director of the D@@ ef@@ en@@ se In@@ tel@@ ligence Agency in 2014 .
in a previous disclosure to House investi@@ g@@ ators F@@ ly@@ n@@ n reported receiving nearly $ 6@@ 8@@ ,@@ 000 in fees and expenses from Russi@@ a-@@ related entities in 2015 .
in addition to the Russi@@ a-@@ related income , Thursday &apos;s fil@@ ing showed that F@@ ly@@ n@@ n received at least $ 5@@ ,@@ 000 as a consul@@ tant to a project to build nuclear power plants in the Middle East .
F@@ ly@@ n@@ n &apos;s work on that project had been dis@@ closed previously , but it was not known that he was paid .
the updated disclosure also confirms that F@@ ly@@ n@@ n had agreed to work with the S@@ C@@ L Group , at the time the British parent company of C@@ amb@@ ri@@ dge An@@ al@@ y@@ tic@@ a , a data science company hi@@ red by Don@@ al@@ d tru@@ mp &apos;s campaign .
one of C@@ amb@@ ri@@ dge &apos;s main finan@@ ci@@ ers is hedge fund mag@@ na@@ te Robert L@@ . Mer@@ cer , whose da@@ u@@ gh@@ ter Re@@ be@@ ka@@ h is an influential conservative donor .
the Washington Po@@ st reported in February that F@@ ly@@ n@@ n had been hi@@ red as an advi@@ ser to S@@ C@@ L Group .
F@@ ly@@ n@@ n was ta@@ pped to help the American subsidi@@ ary of S@@ C@@ L win new U@@ .@@ S@@ . government contracts , according to people familiar with his role .
S@@ C@@ L also hi@@ red one of F@@ ly@@ n@@ n &apos;s former colleagues from Office of the Director of National In@@ tel@@ ligence to lead its government contracting efforts .
F@@ ly@@ n@@ n received no compensation from S@@ C@@ L and performed no actual work , according to a person familiar with his activities .
the new fil@@ ing dis@@ closed that F@@ ly@@ n@@ n received about $ 2@@ 8@@ ,@@ 000 from the tru@@ mp P@@ re@@ si@@ d@@ ential Tran@@ si@@ tion .
the largest source of income dis@@ closed is $ 14@@ 0@@ ,@@ 000 for F@@ ly@@ n@@ n &apos;s work as an advi@@ ser and consul@@ tant to Min@@ ne@@ a@@ po@@ lis@@ -based N@@ J@@ K Hol@@ ding Cor@@ p@@ . Th@@ at firm is led by N@@ asse@@ r Kaz@@ emin@@ y , an Iran@@ i@@ an-@@ born business@@ man now living in the United States .
the As@@ soci@@ ated P@@ ress reported Thursday evening that N@@ J@@ K issued a statement saying that F@@ ly@@ n@@ n &quot; played an advisory role to N@@ J@@ K holdings relative to its investment interests in security . &quot;
N@@ J@@ K funds a technology firm called Gre@@ en@@ Zone Sy@@ stems to which F@@ ly@@ n@@ n serves as vice chairman .
Gre@@ en@@ Zone is led by B@@ ij@@ an K@@ ian , F@@ ly@@ n@@ n &apos;s business partner in F@@ ly@@ n@@ n In@@ tel , a company now under scrutiny for its role in lobbying work for a D@@ ut@@ ch@@ -based business linked to the government of Turkey .
earlier Thursday , the top Democra@@ t on the House Committee on O@@ ver@@ si@@ ght and Government Reform , Re@@ p@@ . Eli@@ ja@@ h E@@ . C@@ U@@ M@@ M@@ I@@ NG@@ S ( M@@ d . ) , asked K@@ ian to provide information about F@@ ly@@ n@@ n &apos;s foreign business contacts and travel .
at the time of a previous security review on F@@ ly@@ n@@ n , K@@ ian told military investi@@ g@@ ators that his partner had several foreign business contacts .
but F@@ ly@@ n@@ n did not tell the same investi@@ g@@ ators about those contacts , according to C@@ U@@ M@@ M@@ I@@ NG@@ S .
a person familiar with the situation said F@@ ly@@ n@@ n nonetheless received his security cle@@ arance at the time .
